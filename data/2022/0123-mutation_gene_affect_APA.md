- (Sci Rep. 2018, CCND1)[Cell Cycle Regulation by Alternative Polyadenylation of CCND1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29717174/)
	* To investigate the biological function of the APA of CCND1, we edited the weak poly(A) signal (PAS) of the proximal APA site to a canonical PAS using the CRISPR/Cas9 method, which can force the cells to use a proximal APA site.
	* Cell cycle profiling and proliferation assays revealed that the proximal APA sites of CCND1 accelerated the cell cycle and promoted cell proliferation, but UTR-APA and CR-APA act via different molecular mechanisms.

The transcripts are further diversified by the use of three alternative polyadenylation signals, which governs whether AU-rich instability elements are present in the 3'-UTR or not. Translation of at least some unr transcripts can occur by internal initiation and is regulated in a cell-cycle-dependent manner; binding of PTB (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein) and Unr to the 5'-UTR inhibits translation, but these are displaced by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C1/C2 (hnRNPC1/C2) during mitosis to stimulate translation. 

Finally, Unr is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation and lysine acetylation, although it is not yet known how these modifications affect Unr activity.

	* Centrosome duplication is coupled with the cell cycle such that centrosomes duplicate once in S phase.
	* Loss of such coupling produces supernumerary centrosomes, a condition called centrosome amplification (CA). 
	* CA promotes cell invasion and chromosome instability, two hallmarks of cancer. 
	*  CEP135, a centriole assembly protein, is dysregulated in some breast cancers. 
	* We previously identified a short isoform of CEP135, CEP135mini, that represses centriole duplication.

Surprisingly, we found that deletion of the distal pA signal had a profound biological impact: transgenic flies without polo pA2 (ΔpA2) died at the pupa stage of development with severe abdominal abnormalities,19 revealing yet another level of polo regulation, through alternative polyadenylation.

# Cell cycle 推断方法

## 尝试机器学习方法(最少需要多少个基因)

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32312741/

Characterizing and inferring quantitative cell cycle phase in single-cell RNA-seq data analysis

技术：荧光成像 + scRNA-seq
* Here, we combined fluorescence imaging with scRNA-seq to measure cell cycle phase and gene expression levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
* By using these data, we developed a novel approach to characterize cell cycle progression.



结论: 常规细胞周期是单个的，我们的分类方法是连续的。只需要使用5个基因，再多不提高精度。

Although standard methods assign cells to discrete cell cycle stages, our method goes beyond this and quantifies cell cycle progression on a continuum. We found that, on average, scRNA-seq data from only five genes predicted a cell's position on the cell cycle continuum to within 14% of the entire cycle and that using more genes did not improve this accuracy.

Transcriptional landscape of the human cell cycle

By applying a combination of global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and histone-modification Chip sequencing (ChIP-seq), we depicted a comprehensive transcriptional landscape at the G0/G1, G1/S, and M phases of breast cancer MCF-7 cells.

Interestingly, we identified genes actively transcribed at early M phase that are longer in length and have low expression and are accompanied by a global increase in active histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me2) and histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) modifications.

Motif analysis of dynamic eRNAs predicted Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) as a key regulator of G1/S transition, and this identification was validated experimentally. 

Taken together, our combined analysis characterized the transcriptional and histone-modification profile of the human cell cycle and identified dynamic transcriptional signatures across the cell cycle.
