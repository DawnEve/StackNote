## Cleavage factor Im 25 as a potential biomarker for prognosis of colorectal cancer (PMID: 35116376)

> 1 Department of Pathology, Jiangmen Central Hospital, Jiangmen, China.

Cleavage factor Im 25 (CFIm25) affects the prognosis and progression of cancer by regulating alternative polyadenylation; however, its role in colorectal cancer remains unclear.

Conclusions: Decreased CFIm25 expression indicates a worse prognosis of colorectal cancer patients and could be a novel target for the treatment of colorectal cancer in the future.




## * [IF=14.0] Heat shock induces premature transcript termination and reconfigures the human transcriptome (PMID: 35114099)
> Mol Cell. 2022 Jan 29;
> Mechanisms of Transcription Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, UK.


Intriguingly, while elongation rates increase upon HS, processivity markedly decreases, so that RNAPII frequently fails to reach the end of genes.

Indeed, HS results in widespread premature transcript termination at cryptic, intronic polyadenylation (IPA) sites near gene 5'-ends, likely via inhibition of U1 telescripting.

This results in dramatic reconfiguration of the human transcriptome with production of new, previously unannotated, short mRNAs that accumulate in the nucleus.

Together, these results shed new light on the basic transcription mechanisms induced by growth at elevated temperature and show that a genome-wide shift toward usage of IPA sites can occur under physiological conditions.

## 长读长 揭示新 polyA信号 (PMID: 35110372)

> Precise gene models using long-read sequencing reveal a unique poly(A) signal in Giardia lamblia
> RNA. 2022 Feb 2
> University of Colorado School of Medicine.


Using long-read sequencing, we characterize the polyadenylation signal and related sequences surrounding Giardia lamblia cleavage sites for over 2600 genes.

We find that G. lamblia uses an AGURAA poly(A) signal, which differs from the mammalian AAUAAA.

Further, we identify 133 genes with evidence of alternative polyadenylation.

Overall, 9574 novel transcripts and 781 genes were identified by comparing and analysing the redundant-removed transcripts of all samples with known reference genome annotations. 

We characterized the alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation events and simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci information based on full-length transcriptome data, which would help us further understand the genome annotation and gene structure of AAA.

## (IF=4.27)The Role of Alternative Polyadenylation in the Regulation of Subcellular RNA Localization (PMID: 35096024)

> Front Genet. 2022 Jan 14
> Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States.

Since the subcellular localization of a transcript is often regulated by 3' UTR sequences, this implies that APA can also change transcript location. However, this connection between APA and RNA localization has only recently been explored. 

In this review, we discuss the role of APA in mRNA localization across distinct subcellular compartments. 

We also discuss current challenges and future advancements that will aid our understanding of how APA affects RNA localization and molecular mechanisms that drive these processes.




## 静电 (CSTF2 和 pre-mRNA) 驱动剪切和加腺苷酸 (PMID: 35090899)

> Electrostatic interactions between CSTF2 and pre-mRNA drive cleavage and polyadenylation
> Biophys J. 2022 Jan 25
> Elahe Masoumzadeh, Petar N Grozdanov, Anushka Jetly, Clinton C MacDonald, Michael P Latham


Nascent pre-mRNA 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation (C/P) involves numerous proteins that recognize multiple RNA elements.

We previously reported the only known disease-related CSTF2 RRM mutant (CSTF2D50A) and showed that it changed the on-rate of RNA binding leading to alternative polyadenylation in brains of mice carrying the same mutation.

These results highlight the importance of the surface charge of the RRM in RNA binding and the balance between nascent mRNA binding and C/P in vivo.

## Nat Commun: 植物中错误注释的微小外显子，进化上保守且重要
> Pervasive misannotation of microexons that are evolutionarily conserved and crucial for gene function in plants
> Nat Commun. 2022 Feb 10
> School of Biological Sciences, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE, 68588, USA.

It is challenging to identify the smallest microexons (≤15-nt) due to their small size.

Analysis reveals that microexons tend to have increased detained flanking introns that require post-transcriptional splicing after polyadenylation.
**注意:** 这是说 先加 polyA 然后再 剪接??

Based on these clusters, we develop an algorithm to genome-wide model coding microexons in 132 plants and find that microexons provide a strong phylogenetic signal for plant organismal relationships.

Microexon modeling reveals diverse evolutionary trajectories, involving microexon gain and loss and alternative splicing. Our work provides a comprehensive view of microexons in plants.

## Neuron: 抑制转录本终止导致mRNA变体多样性降低、神经退化 (PMID: 35139363)

> Suppression of premature transcription termination leads to reduced mRNA isoform diversity and neurodegeneration
> Neuron. 2022 Feb 4
> Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.

Here, we show that the RNA kinase CLP1 regulates mRNA isoform expression through suppression of proximal cleavage and polyadenylation.

These changes resulted in imbalanced mRNA isoform expression of long genes important for neuronal function that were recapitulated in vivo.

Strikingly, we observed the same pattern of reduced mRNA isoform diversity in 3' end sequencing data from brain tissues of patients with neurodegenerative disease.

Together, our results identify a previously uncharacterized role for CLP1 in mRNA 3' end formation and reveal an mRNA misprocessing signature in neurodegeneration that may suggest a common mechanism of disease.

## (IF=3.5) Csf64 删除 缓解了 心脏纤维化，通过 APA
> Cleavage stimulating factor 64 depletion mitigates cardiac fibrosis through alternative polyadenylation
> Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2022 Jan 29
> DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, USA.

Alternative polyadenylation (APA) regulates gene expression by cleavage and addition of poly(A) sequence at different polyadenylation sites (PAS) in 3'UTR, thus, generating transcript isoforms with different lengths. 

Cleavage stimulating factor 64 (CstF64) is an APA regulator which plays a role in PAS selection and determines the length of 3'UTR. 

CstF64 favors the use of proximal PAS, resulting in 3'UTR shortening, which enhances the protein expression by increasing the stability of the target genes.

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of CstF64 in cardiac fibrosis, a key event leading to heart failure (HF). 


---

In addition, HF cardiac fibroblasts showed increased transforming growth factor receptor β1 (TGFβR1) expression consistent with significant shortening in 3'UTR of TGFβR1. 

Therefore, targeting CstF64 mediated RNA processing approach in human HF could provide a new therapeutic treatment strategy for limiting fibrotic remodeling.
