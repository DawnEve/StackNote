Alternative polyadenylation (APA) events may be modulated by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the association between APA quantitative trait loci (apaQTLs)-related SNPs (apaQTL-SNPs) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) risk.

Conclusion: The variant G allele of rs10138506 in CHURC1 was correlated with a longer 3'UTR of CHURC1 mRNA and an increased LUAD risk. Further studies should evaluate the interaction between rs10138506 and different 3'UTR lengths of CHURC1 that regulate LUAD development.

Alternative polyadenylation (APA) yields transcripts differing in their 3'-end, and its regulation is altered in cancer, including prostate cancer. Here we have uncovered a mechanism of APA regulation impinging on the interaction between the exonuclease XRN2 and the RNA-binding protein Sam68, whose increased expression in prostate cancer is promoted by the transcription factor MYC. 

Genome-wide transcriptome profiling revealed a widespread impact of the Sam68/XRN2 complex on APA. 

XRN2 招募 Sam68 吸附到其远端 polyA信号上，促进使用 次优的近端polyA信号。
XRN2 promotes recruitment of Sam68 to its target transcripts, where it competes with the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor for binding to strong polyadenylation signals at distal ends of genes, thus promoting usage of suboptimal proximal polyadenylation signals. 


This mechanism leads to 3' untranslated region shortening and translation of transcripts encoding proteins involved in G1/S progression and proliferation. Thus, our findings indicate that the APA program driven by Sam68/XRN2 promotes cell cycle progression and may represent an actionable target for therapeutic intervention.

The deficit in aged MuSC function in regeneration can be overcome either by morpholino-mediated blockade of CD47 alternative polyadenylation or antibody blockade of thrombospondin-1/CD47 signaling, leading to improved regeneration in aged mice, with therapeutic implications.

Alternative polyadenylation (APA) determines mRNA stability, localisation, translation and protein function. Several diseases, including obesity, have been linked to APA. Studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals (PAS-SNPs) can influence APA and affect phenotype and disease susceptibility. 

The genetic variants identified in the two lines were overlapped with locations of PAS sites obtained from the PolyASite 2.0 database.
