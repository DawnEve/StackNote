Summary

哺乳动物，乳腺癌动物模型中，产后微环境促进肿瘤生长和转移。
The microenvironment of postpartum mammary gland promotes tumor growth and metastasis in animal models and is linked to increased risk of breast cancer and poor disease outcome in patients. 

之前的研究展示了，乳腺癌中CCL8参与转移，是通过调控肿瘤微环境中的肿瘤促进活动。
Our previous studies showed the involvement of the chemokine CCL8 in breast cancer metastasis through modulation of the tumor-promoting activity of the tumor microenvironment. 

这里展示了，乳腺衰退中CCL8高表达，促进第二阶段M2巨噬细胞。
Here we show that CCL8 is highly expressed during mammary gland involution and enhances the infiltration of M2 subtype macrophages at the second phase of involution. 

肿瘤细胞接种到Ccl8缺乏的动物中，表明CCL8加速更年期的肿瘤，而不是未生育的动物。
Cancer cell inoculation studies in Ccl8-deficient animals indicate that CCL8 accelerates tumor onset during involution but not in nulliparous animals. 

删除更年期的巨噬细胞，CCL8不能促肿瘤，说明是通过招募巨噬细胞促进肿瘤的。
Depletion of macrophages abolished the tumor-promoting effect of CCL8 in involution suggesting the specific role of CCL8 in promoting tumor growth by recruiting macrophages. 

以上结果强调，CCL8在产后乳腺癌发展中的作用，提示靶向CCL8在疾病管理中的潜在作用。
These results underscore the role of CCL8 in the development of postpartum breast cancer and suggest the potential value of targeting CCL8 in disease management.

## [2019, IF2021=5.6] CCL8 secreted by tumor-associated macrophages promotes invasion and stemness of glioblastoma cells via ERK1/2 signaling

TAM 是组成恶性胶质瘤很大的细胞群，促进肿瘤生长和入侵，但是机制未知。
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute a large population of glioblastoma and facilitate tumor growth and invasion of tumor cells, but the underlying mechanism remains undefined. 

本文，展示了CCL8在TAM中高表达，促进GBM细胞伪足的形成。
In this study, we demonstrate that chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 8 (CCL8) is highly expressed by TAMs and contributes to pseudopodia formation by GBM cells. 

胶质瘤中CCL8促进微环境中肿瘤细胞的生长。
The presence of CCL8 in the glioma microenvironment promotes progression of tumor cells. 

进一步的，CCL8诱导侵袭，干细胞样GBM细胞， CCR1和CCR5是介导CCL8生物行为的主要受体。
Moreover, CCL8 induces invasion and stem-like traits of GBM cells, and CCR1 and CCR5 are the main receptors that mediate CCL8-induced biological behavior. 

最后，CCL8促进GBM细胞的ERK1/2磷酸化，通过中和抗体阻断TAM分泌的CCL8显著降低胶质瘤的侵袭。
Finally, CCL8 dramatically activates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GBM cells, and blocking TAM-secreted CCL8 by neutralized antibody significantly decreases invasion of glioma cells. 

总结：CCL8是TAM阳关因子，介导侵袭和GBM的干性，靶向CCL8是可能治疗GBM的前瞻策略。
Taken together, our data reveal that CCL8 is a TAM-associated factor to mediate invasion and stemness of GBM, and targeting CCL8 may provide an insight strategy for GBM treatment.


### 细胞获取: 胶原酶+流式(CD14+CD163)

The fresh GBM specimens were dissociated through collagenase I/IV, and then followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to isolate TAMs by the surface marker CD14 and CD163.

### 结论
Taken together, our data show that 
* CCL8 is highly expressed by glioma-associated macrophages, 
* and triggers the invasion and stemness of GBM cells through CCR1 or CCR5. 
* The activation of ERK1/2 the downstream mechanism of CCL8 in GBM cells and blocking TAM-secreted CCL8 may therefore be a target for GBM therapy.

单细胞只扩增3‘端只拿到了部分转录组。
Most methods for single-cell transcriptome sequencing amplify the termini of polyadenylated transcripts, capturing only a small fraction of the total cellular transcriptome. 

这妨碍了检测： lncRNA, 短ncRNA，非pA蛋白编码转录本和splicing 的分析。
This precludes the detection of many long non-coding, short non-coding and non-polyadenylated protein-coding transcripts and hinders alternative splicing analysis. 

这里开发了总转录组单细胞测序，给细胞裂解液的每个片段化的RNA分子加尾。可以平板或液滴。
We, therefore, developed VASA-seq to detect the total transcriptome in single cells, which is enabled by fragmenting and tailing all RNA molecules subsequent to cell lysis. 

The method is compatible with both plate-based formats and droplet microfluidics.

RNA velocity characterization was improved, accurately retracing blood maturation trajectories. 

Moreover, our VASA-seq data provide a comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing during mammalian development, which highlighted substantial rearrangements during blood development and heart morphogenesis.

APA是调节3UTR的机制。
Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread mechanism to generate mRNA isoforms with alternative 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). 

细胞特异，并受环境影响。
The expression of alternative 3' UTR isoforms is highly cell type specific and is further controlled in a gene-specific manner by environmental cues. 

本综述，讨论APA受到的调控，包括 顺式作用元件：RNA和DNA的控制转录、剪切、后处理的因子。
In this Review, we discuss how the dynamic, fine-grained regulation of APA is accomplished by several mechanisms, including cis-regulatory elements in RNA and DNA and factors that control transcription, pre-mRNA cleavage and post-transcriptional processes.

Furthermore, signalling pathways modulate the activity of these factors and integrate APA into gene regulatory programmes.

内含子区的pA变体，包含可变的最后一个外显子，广泛调节在很多生物过程中，受多个因子调控。
Intronic polyadenylation (IPA) isoforms, which contain alternative last exons, are widely regulated in various biological processes and by many factors. 

未知：细胞质调控，转录状态
However, little is known about their cytoplasmic regulation and translational status. 

本文： 转录组和翻译组不同，核与胞质不同。
In this study, we provide the first evidence that the genome-wide patterns of IPA isoform regulation during a biological process can be very distinct between the transcriptome and translatome, and between the nucleus and cytosol. 

乳腺癌细胞系，抗癌药 阿霉素，在全细胞中，显著下调 IPA/last exon 比例，通过偏好上游核糖体。
Indeed, by 3'-seq analyses on breast cancer cells, we show that the genotoxic anticancer drug, doxorubicin, preferentially down-regulates the IPA to the last-exon (IPA:LE) isoform ratio in whole cells (as previously reported) but preferentially up-regulates it in polysomes. 

核内，阿霉素特异下调 IPA:LE 比例。胞质中，上调该比例，核糖体中也是。
We further show that in nuclei, doxorubicin almost exclusively down-regulates the IPA:LE ratio, whereas in the cytosol, it preferentially up-regulates the isoform ratio, as in polysomes. 

聚焦阿霉素上调 胞质 IPA比例和高翻译，识别了 IPA 变体，促进细胞在阿霉素中生存。
Then, focusing on IPA isoforms that are up-regulated by doxorubicin in the cytosol and highly translated (up-regulated and/or abundant in polysomes), we identify several IPA isoforms that promote cell survival to doxorubicin.

Mechanistically, by using an original approach of condition- and compartment-specific CLIP-seq (CCS-iCLIP) to analyze ELAVL1-RNA interactions in the nucleus and cytosol in the presence and absence of doxorubicin, as well as 3'-seq analyses upon ELAVL1 depletion, we show that the RNA-binding protein ELAVL1 mediates both nuclear down-regulation and cytosolic up-regulation of the IPA:LE isoform ratio in distinct sets of genes in response to doxorubicin. 

总的，这些揭示了：亚细胞中 IPA:LE的差异调控，在药物反应中，以及 RNA结合蛋白的协同作用。
Altogether, these findings reveal differential regulation of the IPA:LE isoform ratio across subcellular compartments during drug response and its coordination by an RNA-binding protein.

APA的研究还很浮于表面。
Together, the contributions in this Research Topic describe new discoveries about APA that are likely just scratching the surface of what remains to be learned. 

APA的机制和结果还基本未知，相对于mRNA或剪接。
Despite increasing interest and appreciation of the roles that APA plays to shape transcriptome diversity, mechanisms and consequences of APA are vastly understudied compared to mRNA transcription and/or splicing.

## APA未来的研究方向
In coming years, research will likely continue to focus on the three critical areas that were highlighted in the contributions: 
* 1) 新方法和技术 development of new approaches and technologies to study APA, 
* 2) 剖析调控APA和mRNA变体的机制 dissection of the mechanisms that regulate APA and mRNA isoform expression more broadly, and 
* 3) APA对分子和细胞表型的影响 study of the impact of APA on molecular and cellular phenotypes.




## 机制

一般认为APA是独立调控的，但是mRNA分子上的共同调控位点的证据挑战了这一观点。
The canonical thinking is that APA is regulated, independently of other mRNA processing mechanisms, by separate cleavage and polyadenylation machinery and factors, but evidence for co-regulation of sites across an mRNA molecule challenges this view. 


未来的研究需要理清这些机制之间的直接或间接协调，并解决
* 全长亚型是仅仅是外显子水平的单个调控决定的汇总，
* 还是有意通过看似不同的RNA加工机制的联合作用表达。

Future studies are needed to untangle direct vs. indirect coordination between these mechanisms and address whether 
* full-length isoforms are simply a sum of individual regulatory decisions at the exon level 
* or purposely expressed through the combined actions of seemingly disparate RNA processing mechanisms.

## 展望

* 多物种
* 更细化，多个3UTR调控元件综合分析

Future work will likely focus on characterizing APA in a wider array of organisms and on performing more fine-tuned genetic dissections of individual or combinations of 3’ UTR regulatory elements.

The results show that scAPAmod can accurately identify different patterns of APA usages at the single-cell level.

Our results indicated that CSTF2 is highly expressed in HCC and is correlated with a poor prognosis and high histological grade. 

The knockout of CSTF2 inhibits the tumorigenesis and procession of HCC both in vitro and in vivo. 

Moreover, CSTF2 is associated with enhanced glycolysis. 

Therefore, this study suggests that CSTF2 might be a new prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.
