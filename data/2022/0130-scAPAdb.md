Based on the curated scRNA-seq data from 24 human and 25 mouse normal tissues, we systematically identified cell-type-specific APA events for different cell types and examined the correlations between APA and gene expression level. 

We also estimated the crosstalk between cell-type-specific APA events and microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins.

Currently, scAPAdb collects APA information from > 360 scRNA-seq experiments, covering six species including human, mouse and several other plant species. scAPAdb also provides batch download of data, and users can query the database through a variety of keywords such as gene identifier, gene function and accession number.

scAPAdb would be a valuable and extendable resource for the study of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in APA isoform usages and APA-mediated gene regulation at the single-cell level under diverse cell types, tissues and species.
