Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread mechanism to generate mRNA isoforms with alternative 3' untranslated regions (UTRs).

> Nat Commun. 2018 Jun

Abstract
Most eukaryotic genes express alternative polyadenylation (APA) isoforms with different 3'UTR lengths, production of which is influenced by cellular conditions. 

Here, we show that arsenic stress elicits global shortening of 3'UTRs through preferential usage of proximal polyadenylation sites during stress and enhanced degradation of long 3'UTR isoforms during recovery. 

压力颗粒？
We demonstrate that RNA-binding protein TIA1 preferentially interacts with alternative 3'UTR sequences through U-rich motifs, correlating with stress granule association and mRNA decay of long 3'UTR isoforms. 

By contrast, genes with shortened 3'UTRs due to stress-induced APA can evade mRNA clearance and maintain transcript abundance post stress. 

Furthermore, we show that stress causes distinct 3'UTR size changes in proliferating and differentiated cells, highlighting its context-specific impacts on the 3'UTR landscape. 

Together, our data reveal a global, 3'UTR-based mRNA stability control in stressed cells and indicate that APA can function as an adaptive mechanism to preserve mRNAs in response to stress.

In eukaryotic cells, both alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation (APA) play essential roles in gene regulation network. 

U1 small ribonucleoprotein particle (U1 snRNP) is a major component of spliceosome, and U1 snRNP complex can suppress proximal APA sites through crosstalking with 3' end processing factors. 

本文：敲低或过表达这几个基因，都促进使用近端polyA位点。
However, here we show that both knockdown and overexpression of SNRPA, SNRPC, SNRNP70, and SNRPD2, the U1 snRNP proteins, promote the usage of proximal APA sites in transcriptome level. 


SNRNP70 can drive the phase transition of PABPN1 from droplet to aggregate, which may reduce the repression effects of PABPN1 on the proximal APA sites. 

Additionally, SNRNP70 can also promote the proximal APA sites by recruiting CPSF6, suggesting that the function of CPSF6 on APA is related with other RNA binding proteins and cell context-dependent. 

Consequently, these results reveal that, on the contrary to U1 snRNP complex, the free proteins of U1 snRNP complex can promote proximal APA sites through the interaction with 3' end processing machinery.

Abstract

Most genes in higher eukaryotes express isoforms with distinct 3’ untranslated regions (3’ UTRs), generated by alternative polyadenylation (APA). 

Since 3’ UTRs are predominant locations of post-transcriptional regulation, APA can render such programs conditional, and can also alter protein sequences via alternative last exon (ALE) isoforms. 

We previously used 3’-sequencing from diverse Drosophila samples to define multiple tissue-specific APA landscapes. 

Here, we exploit comprehensive single nucleus RNA-sequencing data (Fly Cell Atlas) to elucidate cell-type expression of 3’ UTRs across >250 adult Drosophila cell types. 

We reveal the cellular bases of multiple tissue-specific APA/ALE programs, such as 3’ UTR lengthening in differentiated neurons and 3’ UTR shortening in spermatocytes and spermatids. 

We trace dynamic 3’ UTR patterns across cell lineages, including in the male germline, and discover new APA patterns in the intestinal stem cell lineage. 

Finally, we correlate expression of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), miRNAs and global levels of cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) factors in several cell types that exhibit characteristic APA landscapes, yielding candidate regulators of transcriptome complexity. 

These analyses provide a comprehensive foundation for future investigations of mechanisms and biological impacts of alternative 3’ isoforms across the major cell types of this widely-studied model organism.







# CPEB4 -抑制因子复合物介导的mRNA降解对即刻早期基因表达的控制 (Genome Biol IF13.5. 2022)

Background: Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 4 (CPEB4) is known to associate with cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of specific mRNAs and assemble an activator complex promoting the translation of target mRNAs through cytoplasmic polyadenylation.

Results: Here, we find that CPEB4 is part of an alternative repressor complex that mediates mRNA degradation by associating with the evolutionarily conserved CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. We identify human CPEB4 as an RNA-binding protein (RBP) with enhanced association to poly(A) RNA upon inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), a condition known to cause widespread degradation of poly(A)-containing mRNA. Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) analysis using endogenously tagged CPEB4 in HeLa cells reveals that CPEB4 preferentially binds to the 3'UTR of immediate early gene mRNAs, at G-containing variants of the canonical U- and A-rich CPE located in close proximity to poly(A) sites. By transcriptome-wide mRNA decay measurements, we find that the strength of CPEB4 binding correlates with short mRNA half-lives and that loss of CPEB4 expression leads to the stabilization of immediate early gene mRNAs. Akin to CPEB4, we demonstrate that CPEB1 and CPEB2 also confer mRNA instability by recruitment of the CCR4-NOT complex.

Conclusions: While CPEB4 was previously known for its ability to stimulate cytoplasmic polyadenylation, our findings establish an additional function for CPEB4 as the RNA adaptor of a repressor complex that enhances the degradation of short-lived immediate early gene mRNAs.

N6-methyladenosine (m6 A) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) are important regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes. 

Recently, it was found that m6 A is closely related to APA. However, the molecular mechanism of this new APA regulation remains elusive. 

Here, we show that YTHDC1, a nuclear m6 A reader, can suppress proximal APA sites and produce longer 3' UTR transcripts by binding to their upstream m6 A sites. 

YTHDC1 can directly interact with the 3' end processing factor FIP1L1 and interfere with its ability to recruit CPSF4. 

液-液相分离
Binding to the m6 A sites can promote liquid-liquid phase separation of YTHDC1 and FIP1L1, which may play an important role in their interaction and APA regulation. 

Collectively, YTHDC1 as an m6 A "reader" links m6 A modification with pre-mRNA 3' end processing, providing a new mechanism for APA regulation.

B cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) treatment has been revolutionized by T cell-based immunotherapies-including chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T) and the bispecific T cell engager therapeutic, blinatumomab-targeting surface glycoprotein CD19. Unfortunately, many patients with B-ALL will fail immunotherapy due to 'antigen escape'-the loss or absence of leukemic CD19 targeted by anti-leukemic T cells. In the present study, we utilized a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening approach to identify modulators of CD19 abundance on human B-ALL blasts. These studies identified a critical role for the transcriptional activator ZNF143 in CD19 promoter activation. Conversely, the RNA-binding protein, NUDT21, limited expression of CD19 by regulating CD19 messenger RNA polyadenylation and stability. NUDT21 deletion in B-ALL cells increased the expression of CD19 and the sensitivity to CD19-specific CAR-T and blinatumomab. In human B-ALL patients treated with CAR-T and blinatumomab, upregulation of NUDT21 mRNA coincided with CD19 loss at disease relapse. Together, these studies identify new CD19 modulators in human B-ALL.

Abstract
Androgen receptor (AR) messenger RNA (mRNA) alternative splicing variants (AR-Vs) are implicated in castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer (PCa), although the molecular mechanism underlying the genesis of AR-Vs remains poorly understood. The CDK12 gene is often deleted or mutated in PCa and CDK12 deficiency is known to cause homologous recombination repair gene alteration or BRCAness via alternative polyadenylation (APA). Here, we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition or genetic inactivation of CDK12 induces AR gene intronic (intron 3) polyadenylation (IPA) usage, AR-V expression, and PCa cell resistance to the antiandrogen enzalutamide (ENZ). We further show that AR binds to the CCNK gene promoter and up-regulates CYCLIN K expression. In contrast, ENZ decreases AR occupancy at the CCNK gene promoter and suppresses CYCLIN K expression. Similar to the effect of the CDK12 inhibitor, CYCLIN K degrader or ENZ treatment promotes AR gene IPA usage, AR-V expression, and ENZ-resistant growth of PCa cells. Importantly, we show that targeting BRCAness induced by CYCLIN K down-regulation with the PARP inhibitor overcomes ENZ resistance. Our findings identify CYCLIN K down-regulation as a key driver of IPA usage, hormonal therapy-induced AR-V expression, and castration resistance in PCa. These results suggest that hormonal therapy-induced AR-V expression and therapy resistance are vulnerable to PARP inhibitor treatment.

Abstract
Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a common genetic regulatory mechanism that generates distinct 3' ends for RNA transcripts. Changes in APA have been associated with multiple biological processes and disease phenotypes. However, the role of hormones and their drug analogs in APA remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated transcriptome-wide the impact of glucocorticoids on APA in 30 human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. We found that glucocorticoids could regulate APA for a subset of genes, possibly by changing the expression of 142 RNA-binding proteins, some with known APA-regulating properties. Interestingly, genes with glucocorticoid-mediated APA were enriched in viral translation-related pathways, while genes with glucocorticoid-mediated expression were enriched in interferon and interleukin pathways, suggesting that glucocorticoid-mediated APA might result in functional consequences distinct from gene expression. For example, glucocorticoids, a pharmacotherapy for severe COVID-19, were found to change the APA but not the expression of LY6E, an important antiviral inhibitor in coronavirus diseases. Glucocorticoid-mediated APA was also cell-type-specific, suggesting an action of glucocorticoids that may be unique to immune regulation. We also observed evidence for genotype-dependent glucocorticoid-mediated APA (referred to as pharmacogenomic-alterative polyadenylation quantitative trait loci), providing potential functional mechanisms for a series of common genetic variants that had previously been associated with immune disorders, but without a clear mechanism. In summary, this study reports a series of observations regarding the impact of glucocorticoids on APA, raising the possibility that this mechanism might have implications for both disease pathophysiology and drug therapy.

Balanced mRNA isoform diversity and abundance are spatially and temporally regulated throughout cellular differentiation. The proportion of expressed isoforms contributes to cell type specification and determines key properties of the differentiated cells. Neurons are unique cell types with intricate developmental programs, characteristic cellular morphologies, and electrophysiological potential. Neuron-specific gene expression programs establish these distinctive cellular characteristics and drive diversity among neuronal subtypes. Genes with neuron-specific alternative processing are enriched in key neuronal functions, including synaptic proteins, adhesion molecules, and scaffold proteins. Despite the similarity of neuronal gene expression programs, each neuronal subclass can be distinguished by unique alternative mRNA processing events. Alternative processing of developmentally important transcripts alters coding and regulatory information, including interaction domains, transcript stability, subcellular localization, and targeting by RNA binding proteins. Fine-tuning of mRNA processing is essential for neuronal activity and maintenance. Thus, the focus of neuronal RNA biology research is to dissect the transcriptomic mechanisms that underlie neuronal homeostasis, and consequently, predispose neuronal subtypes to disease.

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignant tumour, and its heterogeneity is one of its major characteristics. N6-methyladenosine (m6A), N1-methyladenosine (m1A), alternative polyadenylation (APA), and adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing constitute the four most common adenosine-associated RNA modifications and represent the most typical and critical forms of epigenetic regulation contributing to the immunoinflammatory response, tumorigenesis and tumour heterogeneity.

Background: RNA modifications, including adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, alternative polyadenylation, m1A and m6A, play a significant role in tumorigenesis and tumor immunity. However, the functions of RNA modification enzymes (writers) in immunotherapy and tumor microenvironment (TME) remain unknown.

Methods: Nonnegative matrix factorization clustering was applied to identify RNA modification clusters in lung adenocarcinoma, one of the most prevalent subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE algorithms were performed to depict TME characteristics. Additionally, a scoring system called Writer-Score was established to quantify RNA modification patterns and subsequently predict clinical outcomes. We subsequently used RNA sequencing, targeted DNA sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence to further evaluate the efficacy of Writer-Score in NSCLC patients receiving neoadjuvant immunotherapy.

Findings: We identified three distinct RNA modification clusters and two DEGclusters, which were shown to be strongly associated with a variety of TME features and biological processes. Additionally, the Writer-Score served as an important factor in post-transcriptional events and immunotherapy. The Writer-Score was capable of properly predicting the prognosis of NSCLC patients receiving neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy.

Interpretation: Our work systematically analyzed four types of RNA modifications and constructed a scoring system to guide neoadjuvant immunotherapy in NSCLC, which highlighted the writers' roles in post-transcriptional events, TME and neoadjuvant immunotherapy.
