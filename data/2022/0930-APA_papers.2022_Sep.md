RBP被认为是 转录后调控，影响基因表达的方法: 调控RNA的稳定性和降解，胞内定位，选择性剪接和APA，翻译控制。
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been identified as a class of posttranscriptional regulators that can participate in regulating gene expression through the regulation of RNA stabilization and degradation, intracellular localization, alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation, and translational control.

By integrating and analyzing ChIP-seq, CLIP-seq, RNA-seq, and shRNA-seq data in K562 using binding and expression target analysis and Statistical Utility for RBP Functions, we discovered a two-layer regulatory network system centered on these four DRBP-SFs and proposed three possible regulatory models where DRBP-SFs can connect transcriptional and alternative splicing regulatory networks cooperatively in CML.

Abstract

广泛存在，产生不同3UTR
Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread mechanism to generate mRNA isoforms with alternative 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). 

特保特异性，受环境影响特定基因
The expression of alternative 3' UTR isoforms is highly cell type specific and is further controlled in a gene-specific manner by environmental cues. 

本文讨论 影响APA的因素，包括：DNA和RNA的顺式作用元件，以及控制转录、剪切和转录后修饰的因子。
In this Review, we discuss how the dynamic, fine-grained regulation of APA is accomplished by several mechanisms, including cis-regulatory elements in RNA and DNA and factors that control transcription, pre-mRNA cleavage and post-transcriptional processes. 

进一步的，信号通路调控这些因子，把APA整合到基因调控程序中。
Furthermore, signalling pathways modulate the activity of these factors and integrate APA into gene regulatory programmes. 


APA调控异常，可以重编程信号通路的结果，进而控制细胞对环境改变的响应。
Dysregulation of APA can reprogramme the outcome of signalling pathways and thus can control cellular responses to environmental changes. 


除了调控蛋白丰度，APA还调控mRNA的定位，以及蛋白质合成的空间组织。
In addition to the regulation of protein abundance, APA has emerged as a major regulator of mRNA localization and the spatial organization of protein synthesis. 

这个作用增强了蛋白功能调控，通过增加翻译后调控子，或形成蛋白-蛋白互作。
This role enables the regulation of protein function through the addition of post-translational modifications or the formation of protein-protein interactions. 

进一步讨论了最近的变个性的技术，单细胞RNA测序和 CRISPR-Cas 技术，能在任何生物学背景下映射3UTR的特征。
We further discuss recent transformative advances in single-cell RNA sequencing and CRISPR-Cas technologies, which enable the mapping and functional characterization of alternative 3' UTRs in any biological context. 

最后，讨论了基于APA的治疗方法，包括靶向肿瘤APA的化合物，以及退行性疾病的治疗性基因编辑。
Finally, we discuss new APA-based RNA therapeutics, including compounds that target APA in cancer and therapeutic genome editing of degenerative diseases.
