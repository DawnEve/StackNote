Abstract

广泛存在，产生不同3UTR
Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread mechanism to generate mRNA isoforms with alternative 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). 

特保特异性，受环境影响特定基因
The expression of alternative 3' UTR isoforms is highly cell type specific and is further controlled in a gene-specific manner by environmental cues. 

本文讨论 影响APA的因素，包括：DNA和RNA的顺式作用元件，以及控制转录、剪切和转录后修饰的因子。
In this Review, we discuss how the dynamic, fine-grained regulation of APA is accomplished by several mechanisms, including cis-regulatory elements in RNA and DNA and factors that control transcription, pre-mRNA cleavage and post-transcriptional processes. 

进一步的，信号通路调控这些因子，把APA整合到基因调控程序中。
Furthermore, signalling pathways modulate the activity of these factors and integrate APA into gene regulatory programmes. 


APA调控异常，可以重编程信号通路的结果，进而控制细胞对环境改变的响应。
Dysregulation of APA can reprogramme the outcome of signalling pathways and thus can control cellular responses to environmental changes. 


除了调控蛋白丰度，APA还调控mRNA的定位，以及蛋白质合成的空间组织。
In addition to the regulation of protein abundance, APA has emerged as a major regulator of mRNA localization and the spatial organization of protein synthesis. 

这个作用增强了蛋白功能调控，通过增加翻译后调控子，或形成蛋白-蛋白互作。
This role enables the regulation of protein function through the addition of post-translational modifications or the formation of protein-protein interactions. 

进一步讨论了最近的变个性的技术，单细胞RNA测序和 CRISPR-Cas 技术，能在任何生物学背景下映射3UTR的特征。
We further discuss recent transformative advances in single-cell RNA sequencing and CRISPR-Cas technologies, which enable the mapping and functional characterization of alternative 3' UTRs in any biological context. 

最后，讨论了基于APA的治疗方法，包括靶向肿瘤APA的化合物，以及退行性疾病的治疗性基因编辑。
Finally, we discuss new APA-based RNA therapeutics, including compounds that target APA in cancer and therapeutic genome editing of degenerative diseases.

> Cellular stress alters 3'UTR landscape through alternative polyadenylation and isoform-specific degradation
> https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29891946/
> Nat Commun. 2018 Jun

Abstract
Most eukaryotic genes express alternative polyadenylation (APA) isoforms with different 3'UTR lengths, production of which is influenced by cellular conditions. 

Here, we show that arsenic stress elicits global shortening of 3'UTRs through preferential usage of proximal polyadenylation sites during stress and enhanced degradation of long 3'UTR isoforms during recovery. 

压力颗粒？
We demonstrate that RNA-binding protein TIA1 preferentially interacts with alternative 3'UTR sequences through U-rich motifs, correlating with stress granule association and mRNA decay of long 3'UTR isoforms. 

By contrast, genes with shortened 3'UTRs due to stress-induced APA can evade mRNA clearance and maintain transcript abundance post stress. 

Furthermore, we show that stress causes distinct 3'UTR size changes in proliferating and differentiated cells, highlighting its context-specific impacts on the 3'UTR landscape. 

Together, our data reveal a global, 3'UTR-based mRNA stability control in stressed cells and indicate that APA can function as an adaptive mechanism to preserve mRNAs in response to stress.

The global 3′UTR APA changes were also measured by the relative expression difference (RED) score, which was the difference between two samples in ratio (log2) of dPAS isoform abundance (reads per million, RPM) to pPAS isoform abundance. A negative RED value indicates 3′UTR shortening and a positive value 3′UTR lengthening.

真核生物中，splicing和APA都在基因调控网络中起重要作用。
In eukaryotic cells, both alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation (APA) play essential roles in gene regulation network. 


U1 small ribonucleoprotein particle (U1 snRNP) is a major component of spliceosome, and U1 snRNP complex can suppress proximal APA sites through crosstalking with 3' end processing factors. 

本文：敲低或过表达这几个基因(SNRPA, SNRPC, SNRNP70, and SNRPD2)，都促进使用近端polyA位点。
However, here we show that both knockdown and overexpression of SNRPA, SNRPC, SNRNP70, and SNRPD2, the U1 snRNP proteins, promote the usage of proximal APA sites in transcriptome level. 


【相转移】
SNRNP70 能促进 PABPN1(Poly(A) Binding Protein Nuclear 1) 从液滴变为聚集，从而降低 PABPN1 对近端polyA位点的抑制作用(，从而更多的使用远端)。
SNRNP70 can drive the phase transition of PABPN1 from droplet to aggregate, which may reduce the repression effects of PABPN1 on the proximal APA sites. 


另外，SNRNP70 也能通过招募 CPSF6 促进近端polyA，表明 CPSF6 对APA的作用和其他RNA结合蛋白相关，并与细胞环境有关。
Additionally, SNRNP70 can also promote the proximal APA sites by recruiting CPSF6, suggesting that the function of CPSF6 on APA is related with other RNA binding proteins and cell context-dependent. 

结论：与 U1蛋白复合体不同，自由的U1蛋白可以通过与3’端处理机器互作，促进近端APA位点。
Consequently, these results reveal that, on the contrary to U1 snRNP complex, the free proteins of U1 snRNP complex can promote proximal APA sites through the interaction with 3' end processing machinery.

Abstract


APA都是3'UTR区域?
Most genes in higher eukaryotes express isoforms with distinct 3’ untranslated regions (3’ UTRs), generated by alternative polyadenylation (APA). 

3UTR是转录后调控的重点区域，APA可以让这些成为条件调控的，也可以通过最后一个外显子序列改变蛋白序列。
Since 3’ UTRs are predominant locations of post-transcriptional regulation, APA can render such programs conditional, and can also alter protein sequences via alternative last exon (ALE) isoforms. 

之前用果蝇定义了组织特异的APA图谱。
We previously used 3’-sequencing from diverse Drosophila samples to define multiple tissue-specific APA landscapes. 

这里使用 果蝇细胞图谱 计划的单核RNA测序数据，分析细胞类型(>250个)特异的3UTR。
Here, we exploit comprehensive single nucleus RNA-sequencing data (Fly Cell Atlas) to elucidate cell-type expression of 3’ UTRs across >250 adult Drosophila cell types. 

揭示了模式： 分化的神经中3UTR 变长，精子形成中 3UTR缩短。
We reveal the cellular bases of multiple tissue-specific APA/ALE programs, such as 3’ UTR lengthening in differentiated neurons and 3’ UTR shortening in spermatocytes and spermatids. 

在 肠道干细胞谱系 发现新的APA模式。
We trace dynamic 3’ UTR patterns across cell lineages, including in the male germline, and discover new APA patterns in the intestinal stem cell lineage. 

最后，在几个细胞类型中，把 RBP，miRNA 和 CPA因子等做相关分析，发现特有的APA谱图，可能是转录组复杂性的候选调控子。
Finally, we correlate expression of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), miRNAs and global levels of cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) factors in several cell types that exhibit characteristic APA landscapes, yielding candidate regulators of transcriptome complexity. 

提供了该模式生物的3'亚型。
These analyses provide a comprehensive foundation for future investigations of mechanisms and biological impacts of alternative 3’ isoforms across the major cell types of this widely-studied model organism.

CPEB4 和 特定mRNA的3’UTR的胞内polyA元件 相关，
并组装成活性复合体来 通过APA促进靶mRNA的翻译。
Background: Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 4 (CPEB4) is known to associate with cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of specific mRNAs and assemble an activator complex promoting the translation of target mRNAs through cytoplasmic polyadenylation.



Results: Here, we find that CPEB4 is part of an alternative repressor complex that mediates mRNA degradation by associating with the evolutionarily conserved CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. 
CPEB4是一个RBP，抑制HDAC(组蛋白去乙酰化酶)时，它与polyA的联系更强。 而抑制 HDAC 是造成带polyA的mRNA广泛降解的已知原因。
We identify human CPEB4 as an RNA-binding protein (RBP) with enhanced association to poly(A) RNA upon inhibition of class I histone deacetylases (HDACs), a condition known to cause widespread degradation of poly(A)-containing mRNA. 

使用内生带标签的CPEB4的HeLa细胞，光激活 核糖核苷增强交联 + 免疫共沉淀 分析表明: CPEB4倾向结合到早期基因的3UTR上，在靠近polyA位置、通常U-或A-丰富的CPE位置、包含G-的变体位置。
Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) analysis using endogenously tagged CPEB4 in HeLa cells reveals that CPEB4 preferentially binds to the 3'UTR of immediate early gene mRNAs, at G-containing variants of the canonical U- and A-rich CPE located in close proximity to poly(A) sites. 

转录组mRNA降解测试，CPEB4结合与短mRNA半衰期强相关，CPEB4不表达导致早期基因的稳定。
By transcriptome-wide mRNA decay measurements, we find that the strength of CPEB4 binding correlates with short mRNA half-lives and that loss of CPEB4 expression leads to the stabilization of immediate early gene mRNAs. 

类似 CPEB4，我们展示了 CPEB1和CPEB2也通过招募CCR4-NOT 复合体导致mRNA不稳定。
Akin to CPEB4, we demonstrate that CPEB1 and CPEB2 also confer mRNA instability by recruitment of the CCR4-NOT complex.

结论: CPEB4 已知能促进胞内polyA，我们的发现建立了该基因的另外功能：作为一个抑制复合物的RNA接头，增强短半衰期的早期基因mRNA的降解。
Conclusions: While CPEB4 was previously known for its ability to stimulate cytoplasmic polyadenylation, our findings establish an additional function for CPEB4 as the RNA adaptor of a repressor complex that enhances the degradation of short-lived immediate early gene mRNAs.

m6A 能影响 APA，但分子机制不清楚。
N6-methyladenosine (m6 A) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) are important regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes. 
Recently, it was found that m6 A is closely related to APA. However, the molecular mechanism of this new APA regulation remains elusive. 

本文：m6 A reader 基因 YTHDC1，可以抑制 近端APA位点，通过结合到上游m6A位点来产生长3-UTR转录本。
Here, we show that YTHDC1, a nuclear m6 A reader, can suppress proximal APA sites and produce longer 3' UTR transcripts by binding to their upstream m6 A sites. 

YTHDC1 直接互作 3'端处理因子 FIP1L1，干扰其招募 CPSF4 的能力。
YTHDC1 can directly interact with the 3' end processing factor FIP1L1 and interfere with its ability to recruit CPSF4. 

液-液相分离
Binding to the m6 A sites can promote liquid-liquid phase separation of YTHDC1 and FIP1L1, which may play an important role in their interaction and APA regulation. 

Collectively, YTHDC1 as an m6 A "reader" links m6 A modification with pre-mRNA 3' end processing, providing a new mechanism for APA regulation.

Abstract

雄性激素受体 选择性剪切变体(AR-Vs)，在前列腺癌中去势抵抗进展有关，机制未知。
Androgen receptor (AR) messenger RNA (mRNA) alternative splicing variants (AR-Vs) are implicated in castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer (PCa), although the molecular mechanism underlying the genesis of AR-Vs remains poorly understood. 

PC中CDK12基因常常删除或突变，已知CDK12缺失可通过APA导致通过同源重组修复基因或BRCAness。
The CDK12 gene is often deleted or mutated in PCa and CDK12 deficiency is known to cause homologous recombination repair gene alteration or BRCAness via alternative polyadenylation (APA). 

本文：药物抑制CDK12导致AR基因3号内含子pA使用，AR-V变体表达，前列腺癌细胞抵抗雄性激素。
Here, we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition or genetic inactivation of CDK12 induces AR gene intronic (intron 3) polyadenylation (IPA) usage, AR-V expression, and PCa cell resistance to the antiandrogen enzalutamide (ENZ). 

我们进一步展示了AR结合到CCNK基因启动子上，上调 CYCLIN K表达。
We further show that AR binds to the CCNK gene promoter and up-regulates CYCLIN K expression. 

相反，抗雄激素ENZ降低了AR在CCNK基因启动子区的结合，抑制了CYCLIN K的表达。
In contrast, ENZ decreases AR occupancy at the CCNK gene promoter and suppresses CYCLIN K expression.

Similar to the effect of the CDK12 inhibitor, CYCLIN K degrader or ENZ treatment promotes AR gene IPA usage, AR-V expression, and ENZ-resistant growth of PCa cells. 

重要的是，通过 PARP 抑制剂 靶向 BRCAness 能克服 ENZ抗性。
Importantly, we show that targeting BRCAness induced by CYCLIN K down-regulation with the PARP inhibitor overcomes ENZ resistance. 

结论：CYCLIN K下调促进IPA的使用。
Our findings identify CYCLIN K down-regulation as a key driver of IPA usage, hormonal therapy-induced AR-V expression, and castration resistance in PCa.

Abstract


Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a common genetic regulatory mechanism that generates distinct 3' ends for RNA transcripts. Changes in APA have been associated with multiple biological processes and disease phenotypes. 

未知: 激素和药物类似物在APA中的作用还是未知的。
However, the role of hormones and their drug analogs in APA remains largely unknown.

In this study, we investigated transcriptome-wide the impact of glucocorticoids on APA in 30 human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. 

发现：糖皮质激素能影响一个子集基因的APA，可能是通过改变 142个RBP，它们有些受APA调控。
We found that glucocorticoids could regulate APA for a subset of genes, possibly by changing the expression of 142 RNA-binding proteins, some with known APA-regulating properties.

Interestingly, genes with glucocorticoid-mediated APA were enriched in viral translation-related pathways, while genes with glucocorticoid-mediated expression were enriched in interferon and interleukin pathways, suggesting that glucocorticoid-mediated APA might result in functional consequences distinct from gene expression. 


比如：糖皮质激素影响LY6E的APA，但是不影响表达。LY6E是新冠中重要的抗病毒抑制剂。
For example, glucocorticoids, a pharmacotherapy for severe COVID-19, were found to change the APA but not the expression of LY6E, an important antiviral inhibitor in coronavirus diseases. 


糖皮质激素介导的APA也是细胞特异的，表明可能对免疫调控的反应是唯一的。
Glucocorticoid-mediated APA was also cell-type-specific, suggesting an action of glucocorticoids that may be unique to immune regulation.

We also observed evidence for genotype-dependent glucocorticoid-mediated APA (referred to as pharmacogenomic-alterative polyadenylation quantitative trait loci), providing potential functional mechanisms for a series of common genetic variants that had previously been associated with immune disorders, but without a clear mechanism. 

总结：糖皮质激素对APA的影响，对疾病和药物的机制可能有帮助。
In summary, this study reports a series of observations regarding the impact of glucocorticoids on APA, raising the possibility that this mechanism might have implications for both disease pathophysiology and drug therapy.

Balanced mRNA isoform diversity and abundance are spatially and temporally regulated throughout cellular differentiation. The proportion of expressed isoforms contributes to cell type specification and determines key properties of the differentiated cells. Neurons are unique cell types with intricate developmental programs, characteristic cellular morphologies, and electrophysiological potential. Neuron-specific gene expression programs establish these distinctive cellular characteristics and drive diversity among neuronal subtypes. Genes with neuron-specific alternative processing are enriched in key neuronal functions, including synaptic proteins, adhesion molecules, and scaffold proteins. Despite the similarity of neuronal gene expression programs, each neuronal subclass can be distinguished by unique alternative mRNA processing events. Alternative processing of developmentally important transcripts alters coding and regulatory information, including interaction domains, transcript stability, subcellular localization, and targeting by RNA binding proteins. Fine-tuning of mRNA processing is essential for neuronal activity and maintenance. Thus, the focus of neuronal RNA biology research is to dissect the transcriptomic mechanisms that underlie neuronal homeostasis, and consequently, predispose neuronal subtypes to disease.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A), N1-methyladenosine (m1A), alternative polyadenylation (APA), and adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing constitute the four most common adenosine-associated RNA modifications and represent the most typical and critical forms of epigenetic regulation contributing to the immunoinflammatory response, tumorigenesis and tumour heterogeneity.

Background: RNA modifications, including adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, alternative polyadenylation, m1A and m6A, play a significant role in tumorigenesis and tumor immunity. However, the functions of RNA modification enzymes (writers) in immunotherapy and tumor microenvironment (TME) remain unknown.

Methods: Nonnegative matrix factorization clustering was applied to identify RNA modification clusters in lung adenocarcinoma, one of the most prevalent subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE algorithms were performed to depict TME characteristics. Additionally, a scoring system called Writer-Score was established to quantify RNA modification patterns and subsequently predict clinical outcomes. We subsequently used RNA sequencing, targeted DNA sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence to further evaluate the efficacy of Writer-Score in NSCLC patients receiving neoadjuvant immunotherapy.

Findings: We identified three distinct RNA modification clusters and two DEGclusters, which were shown to be strongly associated with a variety of TME features and biological processes. Additionally, the Writer-Score served as an important factor in post-transcriptional events and immunotherapy. The Writer-Score was capable of properly predicting the prognosis of NSCLC patients receiving neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy.

Interpretation: Our work systematically analyzed four types of RNA modifications and constructed a scoring system to guide neoadjuvant immunotherapy in NSCLC, which highlighted the writers' roles in post-transcriptional events, TME and neoadjuvant immunotherapy.
