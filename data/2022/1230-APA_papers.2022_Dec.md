Alternative polyadenylation (APA) gives rise to transcripts with distinct 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), thereby affecting the fate of mRNAs. APA is strongly associated with cell proliferation and differentiation status, and thus likely plays a critical role in the embryo development. 

However, the pattern of APA in mammalian early embryos is still unknown.
