## A cover letter MUST include:

要求

### (1) 长度 

2-12页。
一份手稿，28-32字，两倍行距，每页27行，字号11pt(一篇5万字符)，4-6个图，1-2表格 就是12个打印页。

Paper length in the journal is between two and 12 journal pages. A manuscript of 28-32 typed, DOUBLE-SPACED pages with 27 lines of 11-point text per page (a manuscript of 50,000 characters) with four to six figures and one or two tables will translate to 12 printed pages in the journal.


### (2) 标题 
The title page should include: the title, all authors' names and institutions, the corresponding author's complete contact information, and a running title (50 characters or less, including spaces).

### (3) 类型
Manuscript Type: The general format for all manuscript types (Research, Methods, Resource) is identical (as described below). 

资源类的要简短。
However, RESOURCE articles are expected to be much more succinct. 
The selection of type is based on the content of the manuscript, and will ultimately be decided by the Editor. 

研究性的通常包含重要概念进展，新基因组见解，以及吸引很多人看的分析。
RESEARCH articles generally contain significant conceptual advances and novel genomic insights as well as extensive analyses with wide appeal for a variety of readers. 

方法学，主要是新方法。和其他方法比较，及支持的生物学数据。
METHODS are manuscripts where the primary focus is on a novel methodology; these manuscripts include appropriate comparisons to other approaches in the field and supportive biological data. 

资源报道有用的工具、数据库，大规模信息资源，比如详尽的图谱或数据源，广泛吸引学术界，包含新生物信息或技术。
RESOURCE reports present information on useful tools, databases, or large-scale informational resources, such as detailed maps or data sources, that hold broad appeal for the community at large and include novel biological information or technology.


### (4) General manuscript format: 

送审要加页码，参考文献要按照本刊格式。
Please number all pages for review purposes and ensure in-text references are set in journal format (see below). 

喜欢使用主动时态，而不是被动。
We prefer the manuscript be written in active rather than passive voice. 

如下顺序：标题页，摘要(250以内)，介绍，结果，讨论，方法，数据源(引用的其他文章放到方法中)，竞争，致谢，参考文献。
Manuscript sections should be presented in the following order: TITLE PAGE, ABSTRACT (the abstract cannot exceed 250 words), INTRODUCTION, RESULTS, DISCUSSION, METHODS, DATA ACCESS (including public database accession numbers for all newly generated data and/or reviewer links to deposited data when accessions are not yet public. Previously published accessions should be included in the Methods section where appropriate), COMPETING INTEREST STATEMENT, ACKNOWLEDGMENTS, and REFERENCES. 

致谢后添加作者贡献。
You may also add Author Contributions after ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. 


---
第一稿，图和表放到正文pdf第一次引用的地方。
First version submissions are required to include all FIGURES and TABLES embedded near the place of first citation within the text of the main document file (.pdf). 

图例要在图附近。清晰。不重要的表格放到补充材料中。
Figure legends should appear adjacent to the relevant figure. Figures must be of sufficient quality for review. Tables providing information (such as primer sequences) that are essential for reproducing the work but not essential for understanding the content of the paper should be included only as supplementary data.

特别长的表格，最好放到在线补充材料中。
In addition, extremely lengthy tables are best presented in complete form as online Supplemental Material.

有长表格的作者，我们推荐创建一个单页样例，方便打印（要包含讨论的内容），一份在线电子补充。
We recommend that authors with long tables--e.g., more than one page at 6.5" X 9" with no smaller than 8 pt. type--create a sample single page table for inclusion in print (it should include anything discussed in the text) and include a copy (electronic) of the complete table for display as an online supplement. 

改变格式，比如长表格、方法放到结果前面等，要有足够的的理由，要和编辑讨论。
Some consideration for altered layout format (e.g., inclusion of extra-long tables, or METHODS preceding RESULTS) for manuscripts will be taken into account for reports where an altered format aids in subject comprehension; altering the format MUST be discussed with the Editor. 

---
方法要详尽到专业人员可重复结果。为审稿人准备的补充材料要包含和标注这些(其他地方投稿中的稿件，源代码，等)
The methods should be detailed enough to allow any qualified researcher to duplicate the results. Additional material for reviewers should be included and marked as such (related manuscripts submitted elsewhere, source code for software, etc.).

所有测序数据，SNP，芯片、分子互作数据，及其他数据，必须提交公开数据库。
All sequence data, SNP data, array data, molecular interaction data, and any other data where there is a publicly held database MUST be submitted to these databases. Genome Research will NOT consider manuscripts where data used in the paper is not freely available on either a publicly held website, or in the absence of such a website on the Genome Research website. There are NO exceptions.



使用如下语句，在致谢前的方法中，描述数据可访问性。
Please use the following examples of our boilerplate language to be used in the Data access section, located after Methods and before Acknowledgments:

All raw and processed sequencing data generated in this study have been submitted to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession number GSE123456.

The [specify data types] data generated in this study have been submitted to the NCBI BioProject database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/) under accession number PRJNA123456.

作者要保证正确致谢和引用。 杂志保留查重、撤回论文的权利。
Authors must ensure that all relevant previously published work is properly acknowledged and cited at the appropriate point in the main text, with the correct bibliographic information given in the Reference list. Quotation marks (" "), with the appropriate citation and Reference, should be used where statements made in a previously published work are reproduced verbatim. The journal reserves the right to employ automated tools to identify any instances of plagiarism and to withdraw the article if detected.

作者自己负责获取材料的改编权。
Authors are also responsible for obtaining permission from the rights holder to adapt or reproduce material previously published elsewhere (typically, this will be the publisher) and for including any required permission statement alongside the citation.


---
必须使用批准的术语：基因名、蛋白名，包括斜体(基因名和位点要斜体)、大写适合该物种的术语格式，正文、表格、图片中。
You MUST use approved nomenclature for gene and protein names and symbols, including appropriate use of italics (format ALL gene symbols and loci in italics) and capitalization as it applies for each organism's standard nomenclature format, in text, tables, and figures. 


全基因名字通常不用斜体，不用希腊字母。
Full gene names are generally not in italics and Greek symbols are NEVER used in gene names or symbols. 

蛋白名字使用Roman非斜体。
Protein symbols should appear in Roman (non-italic) type. 

新基因的名字如何查询？
To help you in doing this, you will find links below to nomenclature sites for a variety of organisms. You MUST submit novel genes and proteins to the appropriate databases prior to submission. Novel gene and protein names must be approved prior to publication. For website links for data submission, or for nomenclature rules or for submission of gene or protein names, see [Website Links for Data Submission and Appropriate Nomenclature](https://genome.cshlp.org/site/misc/ifora_weblinks.xhtml)

有不规范用法，在接收后会额外收费。
Failure to use appropriate nomenclature for manuscripts that have been accepted can result in change fees at the time of manuscript processing.





### Article and book references 参考文献

Cite as (name date) in text, not by number. Do NOT include a comma between surname and first initials or periods in initials. Journal abbreviations also should not include punctuation.




### 图片 Figures 

图片不能操纵，除非整图一起处理。会使用软件检测。
The journal will not accept artwork that is manipulated to hide, add, remove, merge, or otherwise change any of the original data. Adjustments to the brightness or contrast of artwork are acceptable, providing they are applied to the entire image and do not obscure any feature of the original. Tools that detect the manipulation of data may be utilized by the journal to ensure that original data have been preserved in the final image.

供外审的图片和表格格式为 pdf 等。
Acceptable Image and Table file formats for reviewing purposes are GIF, TIFF, EPS, PDF, and JPEG. 

电子图片命名必须用作者的first author 名字及图片编号。
Electronic files for figures should be named with the first author's name and the figure number; 

比如， Smith_Fig1.
for example, Smith_Fig1. 

图片文件中也要标上图片编号。
Also be sure to include the figure number on the figure in the file. 


如果接收，图尺寸会根据杂志需要调整；所以，请保持标签、符号等要和图尺寸和细节一致(使用 Helvetica 或类似字体，字号8-10)
If the manuscript is accepted for publication, the size of the figures will be adjusted to fit the journal format; therefore, please try to keep labels, symbols, and other call-out devices in proportion to the figure size and detail (use Helvetica or a similar typeface in point sizes no smaller than 8 pt and no larger than 10 pt. 

图片上的字母 10pt，粗体大写。
Main callouts [e.g., A, B, C, etc.] should be 10 pt. bold capital letters. 

通常，避免使用大量文字，因为缩小时会连起来。
In general, it is best to avoid heavy letters, which often close up when reduced. 

类似的，相同纹理也要避免，
Likewise, colors of similar shades should be avoided because, depending on final art sizing to conform to journal style, similar shades may become difficult to differentiate. 

避免使用浅色，
Also, avoid using very light colors, since these typically do not reproduce well. 


NOTE ALSO: For publication purposes, file type and format must conform to our printer's parameters for TIFF, EPS, PDF, JPEG, or AI. For details on figure format and specifications for manuscripts that are accepted, see [Digital Art Guidelines](http://www.genome.org/misc/ifora_digartsubm.xhtml).



### Supplemental Material 补充材料

补充材料也是同行评审的，必须和结论直接相关，但对理解不是必须的。
Supplemental Material is peer-reviewed and must be directly relevant to the conclusions offered in the main text but non-essential for reader understanding. 

建议简洁，(在一个单个pdf中，带目录)，仔细组织，合理标注。
We strongly recommend it be succinct (preferably presented in a single PDF file with a Table of Contents), organized carefully, and labeled appropriately. 

文件大小要尽可能小。
File sizes should be as small as possible. 

每个补充材料图、表、数据文件，都要在正文引用。
Each supplemental figure, table, movie, or data file must be cited in the main text; 

补充材料要这样命名，下划线链接每个部分，后缀名是对应文件类型。
citations and supplemental files themselves must be named as follows, with underscores connecting all segments in each filename and with the file-type extension in view: Supplemental_Fig_S1.pdf, Supplemental_Fig_S2.eps, Supplemental_Table_S1.xls, Supplemental_Table_S2.pdf, Supplemental_Movie_S1.mov, Supplemental_Methods.pdf, etc. 

提交者使用的软件，要对学术开放。
Authors submitting papers that describe or present a new computer program or algorithm or papers where in-house software is uniquely necessary to reproduce the work should be prepared to make that software freely available for academic and nonprofit use. 

鼓励开源源码，作为补充材料，作为后记。
We encourage authors to also make the source code available as Supplemental Material, for posterity. When submitting a manuscript initially, supplemental files should also include related papers in press or under consideration and permission letters.

在线系统不能使用的类型: Tex(pdf可以), Excel(word可以), bmp, psd, ppt, cdr(转为word,tiff,eps, jpg)
Please note: Files that CANNOT be used by the online system include: Any Tex-type files [convert to a PDF], Excel (.xls) [convert to Word], and Bitmap (.bmp), PICT (.pict), Photoshop (.psd), PowerPoint (.ppt), CorelDRAW (.cdr) [convert all figure files to Word, GIF, TIFF, EPS, or JPEG]. 

在线转换软件 
There is a graphics converter program available as shareware that can convert electronic figures to usable formats at http://www.webattack.com/get/imagetransformer.shtml. This program will NOT upgrade the quality of the image, but can convert the file type to one that can be used by the online system and make your figures suitable for review purposes.
