# Abstract

Background: APA可调控基因表达，但在肺腺癌中，具体的APA事件，及其潜在的生物学或临床意义未知。
- Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a pervasive posttranscriptional mechanism regulating gene expression. 
- However, the specific dysregulation of APA events and its potential biological or clinical significance in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remain unclear.

Methods: 搜集2个公共数据集中的肺癌数据：GEO和TCGA。使用DaPar算法。
- Here, we collected RNA-Seq data from two independent datasets: [`GSE40419`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40419) (n = 146) and `The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) LUAD` (n = 542). 
- The [`DaPars algorithm`](https://github.com/ZhengXia/dapars) was employed to characterize the APA profiles in tumor and normal samples. 
- Spearman correlation was used to assess the effects of APA regulators on 3' UTR changes in tumors. 
- The Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify clinically relevant APA events and regulators. 
- We stratified 512 patients with LUAD in the TCGA cohort through consensus clustering based on the expression of APA factors.

Findings: 
- We identified remarkably consistent alternative 3' UTR isoforms between the two cohorts, most of which were shortened in LUAD. 
- Our analyses further suggested that aberrant usage of proximal polyA sites resulted in escape from miRNA binding, thus increasing gene expression. 
- Notably, we found that the 3' UTR lengths of the mRNA transcriptome were correlated with the expression levels of APA factors. 
- We further identified that CPSF2 and CPEB3 may serve as key regulators in both datasets. 
- Finally, `four LUAD subtypes` according to different `APA factor expression patterns` displayed distinct clinical results and oncogenic features related to tumor microenvironment including immune, metabolic, and hypoxic status.

---
Interpretation: 
- Our analyses characterize the APA profiles among patients with LUAD and identify two key `regulators for APA events in LUAD, CPSF2 and CPEB3`, which could serve as the potential prognostic genes in LUAD.
