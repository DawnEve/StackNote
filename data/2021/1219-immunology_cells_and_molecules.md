## Cd47 - Sirpa

1. Figure 2. Roles of the CD47–SIRPa signalling pathway in the hematopoietic and immune systems. 
- (a) Negative regulation of phagocytosis by CD47–SIRPa ligation. Ligation of SIRPa (on macrophages) by CD47 (on RBCs) promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of SIRPa and its subsequent association with the phosphatase SHP-1, resulting in inhibition of phagocytosis (operating as a ‘do-not-eat-me signal’) of RBCs by macrophages. 
- (b) Putative roles of SIRPa in differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Th17 cells. After uptake of pathogens, immature DCs become activated and mature (i), migrate to peripheral lymph nodes (ii) and, subsequently, prime naive CD4+ T cells (iii), which differentiate into Th17 cells in the presence of IL-6 and transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b). SIRPa, potentially through its interaction with CD47, has multiple roles in these processes. For instance, it is likely that SIRPa on DCs promotes the activation of T cells (presumably through interaction with CD47 on the T cells) in a manner functionally similar to that apparent for other costimulatory molecules on DCs. The CD47–SIRPa pathway is also implicated in the development of CD8aCD11c+ DCs.
