Here we demonstrate that the synthesis of Cyclin B1 during the oocyte meiotic cell cycle is defined by the selective translation of mRNA variants generated through alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA).

Using gene editing in mice, we introduced mutations into the proximal and distal polyadenylation elements of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the Ccnb1 mRNA. Through in vivo loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that the translation of mRNA with a short 3' UTR specifies Cyclin B1 protein levels that set the timing of meiotic re-entry. In contrast, translation directed by a long 3' UTR is necessary to direct Cyclin B1 protein accumulation during the MI/MII transition. These findings establish that the progression through the cell cycle is dependent on the selective translation of multiple mRNA variants generated by APA.

Methods: In this study we performed transcriptome and DNA methylome analyses with Ctenopharyngodon idellus kidney (CIK) cells infected with GCRV at 0, 4, and 8 h post infection (hpi), respectively.

Particularly, we found that biological processes of cytoskeleton organization and regulation of microtubule polymerization are statistically enriched in the genes with altered 3'UTRs.
