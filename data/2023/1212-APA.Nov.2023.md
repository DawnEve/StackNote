The spatial localization of RNA within cells is closely related to its function and also involved in cell fate determination. However, the atlas of RNA distribution within cells and dynamic changes during the developmental process are largely unknown. 

胚胎干细胞发育过程中，五个细胞内的位置的RNA，测序。
In this study, `five subcellular components, including cytoplasmic extract, membrane extract, soluble nuclear extract, chromatin-bound nuclear extract, and cytoskeletal extract`, were isolated and the rules of subcellular RNA distribution in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and its change during hESC differentiation are summarized for the first time.

The overall distribution patterns of coding and non-coding RNAs are revealed. 

Interestingly, some developmental genes are found to be transcribed but confined to the chromatin in undifferentiated hESC. 

选择性剪切和APA赋予同一个基因不同异构体之间的空间异质性。
Unexpectedly, alternative splicing and polyadenylation endow spatial heterogeneity among different isoforms of the same gene. 

Finally, the dynamic pattern of RNA distribution during hESC differentiation is characterized, which provides new clues for a comprehensive understanding hESC pluripotency and differentiation.

To obtain mechanistic insights into polyA site optimization across the human genome, we develop deep/machine learning models to identify genome-wide putative polyA sites at unprecedented nucleotide-level resolution and calculate their strength and usage in the genomic context. 

Our models quantitatively measure position-specific motif importance and their crosstalk in polyA site formation and cleavage heterogeneity. 

- The intronic site expression is governed by the surrounding splicing landscape. 
- The usage of alternative polyA sites in terminal exons is modulated by their relative locations and distance to downstream genes.








# 减数分裂中APA控制 CCNB1的转录本使用 (Nucleic Acids Res. 2023)
> Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation of the Ccnb1 mRNA defines accumulation of cyclin protein during the meiotic cell cycle

> PMID: 38048302

Here we demonstrate that the synthesis of Cyclin B1 during the oocyte meiotic cell cycle is defined by the selective translation of mRNA variants generated through alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA).

Using gene editing in mice, we introduced mutations into the proximal and distal polyadenylation elements of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the Ccnb1 mRNA. Through in vivo loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that the translation of mRNA with a short 3' UTR specifies Cyclin B1 protein levels that set the timing of meiotic re-entry. In contrast, translation directed by a long 3' UTR is necessary to direct Cyclin B1 protein accumulation during the MI/MII transition. These findings establish that the progression through the cell cycle is dependent on the selective translation of multiple mRNA variants generated by APA.

Methods: In this study we performed transcriptome and DNA methylome analyses with Ctenopharyngodon idellus kidney (CIK) cells infected with GCRV at 0, 4, and 8 h post infection (hpi), respectively.

Particularly, we found that biological processes of cytoskeleton organization and regulation of microtubule polymerization are statistically enriched in the genes with altered 3'UTRs.
