The proliferating and quiescent (7-day contact inhibited) cells were treated with actinomycin D to stop transcription and the cells were harvested at different time points (0. 2, 4, 8 hours) for RNA isolation and global sequencing of 3´ ends.

成纤维细胞中，静息状态下，distal 位点更稳定。
分裂状态下，不是这样。
Results: In two different fibroblast strains (12-1 and 12-3), we found that isoforms terminating at distal polyadenylation sites were more stable than isoforms terminating at proximal polyadenylation sites in quiescent, but not proliferating, fibroblasts.
