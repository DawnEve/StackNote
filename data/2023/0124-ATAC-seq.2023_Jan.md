单细胞染色质测序。
Here, we identify gene-regulatory landscapes in a wide breadth of functional and dysfunctional CD8+ TIL states covering four cancer entities using single-cell chromatin profiling. 

肿瘤-对照 样本，分析TIL的scRNA-seq和scATAC-seq，通过超级增强子分析发现 细胞状态特意的基因。
We map enhancer-promoter interactions in human TILs by integrating single-cell chromatin accessibility with single-cell RNA-seq data from tumor-entity-matching samples and prioritize cell-state-specific genes by super-enhancer analysis.


处理在TIL中揭示实体特异的染色质重塑，我们的分析还识别出一个共有的TIL失能染色质路径，和这个过程中的关键增强子、转录调控子、调控基因。
Besides revealing entity-specific chromatin remodeling in exhausted TILs, our analyses identify a common chromatin trajectory to TIL dysfunction and determine key enhancers, transcriptional regulators, and deregulated genes involved in this process. 


最后，在一些免疫疗法相关的位点，验证增强子调控，主要是通过CRISPR靶向非编码调控元件。
Finally, we validate enhancer regulation at immunotherapeutically relevant loci by targeting non-coding regulatory elements with potent CRISPR activators and repressors. 

结论：提供了理解和操作 TIL 的 细胞状态特异的基因调控线索 提供了一个框架。
In summary, our study provides a framework for understanding and manipulating cell-state-specific gene-regulatory cues from human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.







# scRNA-seq整合多组学测序揭示 SERPINE2 是RCC中转移的靶点 (Cell Death Dis. 2023 Jan, IF=8.4)

肿瘤 + 微环境。

However, the mechanisms underlying genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic alternations in RCC progression have not been completely defined. 

多组学样本：8个RCC病人的scRNA-seq，包括2个配对的早期、转移灶(淋巴结)，
及 RCC (Caki-1) vs HK-2细胞系的 Hi-C，ATAC-seq，RNA-seq 数据。
In this study, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were obtained from eight tissue samples of RCC patients, including two matched pairs of primary and metastatic sites (lymph nodes), along with Hi-C, transposable accessible chromatin by high-throughput (ATAC-seq) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) between RCC (Caki-1) and human renal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2).


- Comparison of the hierarchical structure showed that SERPINE2 was related to these NNMF expression programs, and at the same time targeted the switched compartment.
- SERPINE2 was highly expressed in RCC tissues and lowly expressed in para-tumor tissues or HK-2 cell line. 
- In addition, SERPINE2 could activate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway.
