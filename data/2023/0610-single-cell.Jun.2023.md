问题: 肾脏细胞类型缺乏参考
While the amount of studies involving single-cell or single-nucleus RNA-sequencing technologies grows exponentially within the biomedical research area, the kidney field requires reference transcriptomic signatures to allocate each cluster its matching cell type. 

数据：
The present meta-analysis of 39 previously published datasets, from 7 independent studies, involving healthy human adult kidney samples, offers a set of 24 distinct consensus kidney cell type signatures. 

作用:
The use of these signatures may help to assure the reliability of cell type identification in future studies involving single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomics while improving the reproducibility in cell type allocation.

问题:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis have provided an unprecedented resolution for the studies on diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, the early changes in the retina in diabetes remain unclear. 

数据:
A total of 8 human and mouse scRNA-seq datasets, containing 276,402 cells were analyzed individually to comprehensively delineate the retinal cell atlas. 

怎么做的 scRNA-seq & GWAS 整合分析?
Additionally, the interneurons, especially BCs, were the most vulnerable cells to diabetes by integrating scRNA-seq and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) analyses. 

结论：
In conclusion, this study delineated a cross-species retinal cell atlas and uncovered the early pathological alterations in the retina of T2D mice.

Keywords: DNA methylation haplotypes; deep learning; enhancer; gene expression.

DNA甲基化在 染色质结构和 转录组调控中是一个重要的表观调控机制。
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation (DNAm) is an important epigenetic mechanism that plays a role in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation. 

揭示DNAm和基因表达的关系，对理解甲基化对转录本的活性很重要。
Elucidating the relationship between DNAm and gene expression is of great importance for understanding its role in transcriptional regulation. 

缺点:
1 常规是构建机器学习膜型，根据启动子区的平均甲基化程度预测基因表达。
The conventional approach is to construct machine-learning-based methods to predict gene expression based on mean methylation signals in promoter regions. 

2 然而，这类策略仅仅解释了 25% 的基因表达变异，所以还不够阐明 DNAm 和 转录活性的关系。
However, this type of strategy only explains about 25% of gene expression variation, and hence is inadequate in elucidating the relationship between DNAm and transcriptional activity. 

3 另外，使用平均甲基化作为输入，忽视了可被DNAm单倍体型反应的细胞群体的异质性。
In addition, using mean methylation as input features neglects the heterogeneity of cell populations that can be reflected by DNAm haplotypes. 


方法： 基于深度学习的方法，基于DNAm单倍体型 近端启动子和远端增强子，预测 基因表达量。
We here developed TRAmaHap, a novel deep-learning framework that predicts gene expression by utilizing the characteristics of DNAm haplotypes in proximal promoters and distal enhancers. 

使用人和小鼠的正常组织做基础数据，准确性:
Using benchmark data of human and mouse normal tissues, TRAmHap shows much higher accuracy than existing machine-learning based methods, by explaining 60~80% of gene expression variation across tissue types and disease conditions. 


Our model demonstrated that gene expression can be accurately predicted by DNAm patterns in promoters and long-range enhancers as far as 25 kb away from transcription start site, especially in the presence of intra-gene chromatin interactions.

# T-BET和EOMES维持成熟的人类NK细胞身份和抗肿瘤功能 (J Clin Invest., 2023IF=19.4)

> PMID: 37279078

Since T-box transcription factors (TFs) T-BET and EOMES are necessary for initiation of NK cell development, their ongoing requirement for mature NK cell homeostasis, function, and molecular programming remains unclear. 

Our study reveals the critical importance of sustained EOMES and T-BET expression to orchestrate mature NK cell function and identity.
