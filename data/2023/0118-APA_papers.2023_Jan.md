We designed an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting the polyadenylation signal of human secreted IgE to redirect IgE transcript polyadenylation from the secreted form to the membrane form.

Maturation of the 3' end of almost all eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) requires cleavage and polyadenylation.

骨组织愈合，APA的影响还不清楚。
Endochondral ossification is a central process in bone healing, but the impact of APA on gene expression during this process is unknown.

全局3UTR缩短，并且表达量上升。
Importantly, the progression of endochondral ossification involves global 3'UTR shortening, which is coupled with an increased abundance of shortened transcripts relative to other transcripts; these results highlight the role of APA in promoting gene expression during endochondral bone formation.

调控网络：APA促进Col1a1和Col1a2基因表达。
Our mechanistic studies of transcripts that undergo APA in the fracture callus revealed an intricate regulatory network in which APA enhances the expression of the collagen, type I, alpha 1 (Col1a1) and Col1a2 genes, which encode the 2 subunits of the abundantly expressed protein collagen 1.

缩短的基因3UTR部分有 miR-29a-3p结合位点，该miRNA促进mRNA降解。
APA exerts this effect by shortening the 3'UTRs of the Col1a1 and Col1a2 mRNAs, thus removing the binding sites of miR-29a-3p, which would otherwise strongly promote the degradation of both transcripts.

Taken together, our study is the first to characterize the crucial roles of APA in regulating the 3'UTR landscape and modulating gene expression during fracture healing.

therefore, we hypothesized that altered APA contributes to progression of colorectal cancer, and that measurement of APA may lead to discovery of novel biomarkers.

Experimental design: We used next-generation sequencing to directly measure global patterns of APA changes during colorectal carcinoma progression in 15 human patient samples. Results were validated in a larger cohort of 50 patients, including 5 normal/carcinoma pairs from individuals.

编码与 lncRNA都有
The 3' end of most protein-coding genes and long non-coding RNAs is cleaved and polyadenylated. Recent discoveries have revealed that a large proportion of these genes contains more than one polyadenylation site. 

影响
Therefore, alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread phenomenon, generating mRNAs with alternative 3' ends. APA contributes to the complexity of the transcriptome by generating isoforms that differ either in their coding sequence or in their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), thereby potentially regulating the function, stability, localization and translation efficiency of target RNAs. 

Here, we review our current understanding of the polyadenylation process and the latest progress in the identification of APA events, mechanisms that regulate poly(A) site selection, and biological processes and diseases resulting from APA.
