第一句话值得学习: 
`
Epigenetics studies mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and alternative polyadenylation that can modify gene activity without changing the underlying DNA nucleotide base-pair structure. Because these changes are reversible, they have potential in developing novel therapeutics.

标本: 

Ethmoidal samples from CRS and inferior turbinate mucosal tissue samples from controls without CRS were studied.

甲基化测序方法:
DNA methylation was studied by Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing. 

分析包:
RADMeth® biostatistical package was used to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between CRS and controls.

上游调控子和通路分析
Ingenuity Pathway analysis of DMRs was performed to identify top upstream regulators and canonical pathways. 

病人 vs 对照:
Ninety-three samples from 64 CRS subjects (36 CRSwNP; 28 CRSsNP) and 29 controls were studied. 

CRS and control samples differed in 13 662 CpGs sites and 1381 DMRs. 

Top upstream regulators identified included: 
1. CRS versus controls: TGFB1, TNF, TP53, DGCR8, and beta-estradiol. 
2. CRSwNP versus controls: TGFB1, CTNNB1, lipopolysaccharide, ID2, and TCF7L2.

Changes of mRNA 3'UTRs by alternative polyadenylation (APA) have been associated to numerous pathologies, but the mechanisms and consequences often remain enigmatic.

Targeting of RNA transcripts to axons is one of the mechanisms that allows rapid local translation of proteins in response to extracellular signals.
将RNA转录物靶向轴突是响应细胞外信号而实现蛋白质快速局部翻译的机制之一。

However, how 3' UTRs contribute to mRNA metabolism and the nature of RBP complexes responsible for these functions remain elusive.
然而，3' utr如何促进mRNA代谢以及负责这些功能的RBP复合物的性质仍然是未知的。


方法:
We performed 3' end sequencing of RNA isolated from cell bodies and axons of sympathetic neurons exposed to either Nerve Growth factor (NGF) or Neurotrophin 3 (NT-3). 

NGF and NT-3 are growth factors essential for sympathetic neuron development through distinct signalling mechanisms. Whereas NT-3 acts mostly locally, NGF signal is retrogradely transported from axons to cell bodies. 


结果:
We discovered that both NGF and NT-3 affect transcription and alternative polyadenylation in the nucleus and induce the localization of specific 3'UTR isoforms to axons, including short 3'UTR isoforms found exclusively in axons. 

整合 CLIP 测序数据: 长UTR转录本结合RBP，到达轴突后，变成短转录本。
The integration of our data with CLIP sequencing data supports a model whereby long 3'UTR isoforms associate with RBP complexes in the nucleus, and upon reaching the axons, are remodelled locally into shorter isoforms. 

结论:
Our findings shed new light into the complex relationship between nuclear polyadenylation, mRNA localisation and local 3'UTR remodelling in developing neurons.

The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is a widely cultivated shellfish in the world, while its transcriptome diversity remains less unexplored due to the limitation of short reads.


We further developed a Drupal based webserver, Cgtdb, which can be used for transcriptome visualization, sequence alignment, and functional genome annotation analyses.

This work provides valuable resources and a useful tool for integrative analysis of various transcriptome datasets in C. gigas, which will serve as an essential reference for functional annotation of the oyster genome.
