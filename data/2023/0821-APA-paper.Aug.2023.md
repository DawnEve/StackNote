第一句话值得学习: 
`
Epigenetics studies mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and alternative polyadenylation that can modify gene activity without changing the underlying DNA nucleotide base-pair structure. Because these changes are reversible, they have potential in developing novel therapeutics.

Changes of mRNA 3'UTRs by alternative polyadenylation (APA) have been associated to numerous pathologies, but the mechanisms and consequences often remain enigmatic.

方法: 从(NFG or NT-3处理的)交感神经神经元的`细胞体 和 轴突` 分别提取RNA，做3端测序。
We performed 3' end sequencing of RNA isolated from cell bodies and axons of sympathetic neurons exposed to either Nerve Growth factor (NGF) or Neurotrophin 3 (NT-3).

- NT-3: 局部起作用
- NGF: 从轴突转运到细胞体


结果:
We discovered that both NGF and NT-3 affect transcription and alternative polyadenylation in the nucleus and induce the localization of specific 3'UTR isoforms to axons, including short 3'UTR isoforms found exclusively in axons. 
在轴突也发现 短转录本。

整合 CLIP 测序数据: 长UTR转录本结合RBP，到达轴突后，变成短转录本。

The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is a widely cultivated shellfish in the world, while its transcriptome diversity remains less unexplored due to the limitation of short reads.

We further developed a Drupal based webserver, Cgtdb, which can be used for transcriptome visualization, sequence alignment, and functional genome annotation analyses.

This work provides valuable resources and a useful tool for integrative analysis of various transcriptome datasets in C. gigas, which will serve as an essential reference for functional annotation of the oyster genome.

Yet, only 14 Mendelian disorders have been associated with hexamer variants. This is likely an under-ascertainment as hexamers are not well defined and not routinely examined in molecular analysis.

在种群中，
主导的polyA信号，其相关变异较低，相对于非主导对照和三聚体。
The predominant hexamers had fewer observed variants compared to non-predominant hexamers and trimer controls, and CADD scores for variants in these hexamers were significantly higher than controls.

这些主导polyA信号区域的变异，可以作为人类疾病的候选，为此，提出六聚体突变作为疾病分类标准。

# 癌细胞中pre-mRNA 3'端加工活性的升高使其易受切割和聚腺苷化的抑制 (NC, 2023)

> 小分子抑制剂 JTE-607 的作用机制：通过通读 和 APA 影响基因表达。

Cleavage and polyadenylation (CPA) is responsible for 3' end processing of eukaryotic poly(A)+ RNAs and preludes transcriptional termination. 

JTE-607, which targets CPSF-73, is the first known CPA inhibitor (CPAi) in mammalian cells. 

Here we show that JTE-607 perturbs gene expression through both transcriptional readthrough and alternative polyadenylation (APA). 

敏感性基因和PCF11敲除类似，可能是 CPAi的转录指纹。
Sensitive genes are associated with features similar to those previously identified for PCF11 knockdown, underscoring a unified transcriptomic signature of CPAi. 

JTE-607 对APA位点的抑制程度，和用量相关，和提高的CPA活性相关。 比如过表达 FIP1后，JTE-607 的干扰效果就更大。
The degree of inhibition of an APA site by JTE-607 correlates with its usage level and, consistently, cells with elevated CPA activities, such as those with induced overexpression of FIP1, display greater transcriptomic disturbances when treated with JTE-607. 

另外， JTE-607 引起S期危机，因此与DNA损伤修复抑制剂有协同作用。
Moreover, JTE-607 causes S phase crisis and is hence synergistic with inhibitors of DNA damage repair pathways. 

- hence [hens] adv. 因此；之后
- synergistic [ˌsɪnəˈdʒɪstɪk] adj. 协同的；协作的，协同作用的

结论：CPA活性和细胞分裂速率是 CPAi 介导的细胞死亡决定因素，可能：CPA抑制剂 抑制某些癌症。
Together, our data reveal CPA activity and proliferation rate as determinants of CPAi-mediated cell death, raising the possibility of using CPAi as an adjunct therapy to suppress certain cancers.

公开渠道收集 551 个表达谱，正常，ESCC，EAC，细胞系。
随后系统比较：表达，启动子活性，AS，APA，基因融合。
We collected 551 gene expression profiles from publicly available sources, including normal, ESCC, and EAC tissues or cell lines. Subsequently, we conducted a systematic analysis to compare the transcriptomes of these samples at various levels, including gene expression, promoter activity, alternative splicing (AS), alternative polyadenylation (APA), and gene fusion.

- fig1: mRNA
- fig2: lncRNA
- fig6: APA


结果 Results: 
发现了7个基因簇: normal, ESCC, EAC 组织。
Seven distinct cluster gene expression patterns were identified among the differentially expressed genes in normal, ESCC, and EAC tissues. 
富集到 PI3K-Akt 信号通路，细胞外基质组织的激活，表现出对表皮发育的抑制。
These patterns were enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the activation of extracellular matrix organization and exhibited repression of epidermal development. 

Notably, we observed additional genes or unique expression levels enriched in these shared pathways and biological processes related to tumor development and immune activation. In addition to the differentially expressed genes, there was an enrichment of lncRNA co-expression networks and downregulation of promoter activity associated with the repression of epidermal development in both ESCC and EAC. This indicates a common feature between these two cancer subtypes. 

APA 模式可能和细菌或病毒感染后宿主基因的表达相关。
Furthermore, differential AS and APA patterns in ESCC and EAC appear to partially affect the expression of host genes associated with bacterial or viral infections in these subtypes. 

ESCC and EAC 之间没有融合基因，什么意思？？？
No gene fusions were observed between ESCC and EAC, thus highlighting the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying these two cancer subtypes.


> 结论 Conclusions: 
We conducted a comprehensive comparison of ESCC and EAC transcriptomes and uncovered shared and distinct transcriptomic signatures at multiple levels. These findings suggest that ESCC and EAC may exhibit common and unique mechanisms involved in tumorigenesis.

背景: HB突变少。AS与肿瘤进展有关，特别是低突变的肿瘤。
Hepatoblastoma (HB) is a common pediatric malignant liver tumor that is characterized by a low level of genetic mutations. Alternative splicing (AS) has been shown to be closely associated with cancer progression, especially in tumors with a low mutational burden. However, the role of AS in HB remains unknown.

结果：
Functionally, PABPN1 acts as an oncofetal splicing regulator in HB by promoting cell proliferation and DNA damage repair via inducing the intron retention of SNHG19. Knock-down of PABPN1 increases the cisplatin sensitivity of HB PDOs.

# 类器官（Organoids）

类器官（Organoids）指利用成体干细胞或多能干细胞进行体外三维（3D）培养而形成的具有一定空间结构的组织类似物。尽管类器官并不是真正意义上的人体器官，但能在结构和功能上模拟真实器官，能够最大程度地模拟体内组织结构及功能并能够长期稳定传代培养。


## 发展历史

- 早在 20 世纪 80 年代，“organoid”一词就已经提出, 1907年，美国贝克罗莱那大学教授威尔逊发现通过机械分离的海绵细胞可以重新聚集并自组织成为新的具有正常功能的海绵有机体，是未来类器官技术发展的源头。威尔逊的研究证明了成年的有机体在无需外界帮助、无需从特定的解剖学阶段开始，也具有完整的信息并可以成功发育成新的有机体。
- 当代类器官的发展成果，主要集中在近十余年。2009年，Hans Clevers实验室使用单个鼠LGR5+肠干细胞在体外自组织成为具有肠隐窝-绒毛结构的肠类器官，开启了类器官发展的新篇章。


目前，多种脏器类器官已被成功构建，其中包括小肠、胃、结肠、肺、膀胱、大脑、肝脏、胰腺、肾脏、卵巢、食道、心脏等，不仅包括正常器官组织类器官，还有相应肿瘤组织类器官。

近几年涉及类器官研究的文献数量呈直线上升趋势，其中不乏多篇CNS等各大顶级期刊文献。中国发表的类器官文献数量在全球的排名从第六位（2009-2019年）跃至第二位（2020年），今次与美国。

> 2021年，类器官被列为“十四五”国家重点研发计划重点专项，随着相关研究不断深入，我国类器官技术水平将进一步提升，同时在相关企业积极布局下，类器官市场化程度将不断提升。


## 类器官模型与其他模型比较

目前主要应用临床药物筛选的模型主要分为2D细胞模型，3D类器官和人源性动物移植模型（PDX）。其中肿瘤药物筛选模型需要满足在短时间内出具药敏检测结果、药物筛查通量高、预测效果准确这三个方面，而类器官在这三方面对比其他药筛方法都显现出了强劲优势。

In this study, using global proteomic analysis, we identified a novel Cyclin K degrader, T4, which was previously discovered through phenotypic screening for alternative polyadenylation regulation. 

T4 and TR-213 are structurally distinct from other Cyclin K degraders and can be used as novel chemical tools to further analyze the degradation of Cyclin K and the regulation of alternative polyadenylation.
