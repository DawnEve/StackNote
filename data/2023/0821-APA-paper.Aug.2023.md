第一句话值得学习: 
`
Epigenetics studies mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and alternative polyadenylation that can modify gene activity without changing the underlying DNA nucleotide base-pair structure. Because these changes are reversible, they have potential in developing novel therapeutics.

Changes of mRNA 3'UTRs by alternative polyadenylation (APA) have been associated to numerous pathologies, but the mechanisms and consequences often remain enigmatic.

Collectively, we propose that targeting of the CPSF complex, leading to widespread alternative polyadenylation of host transcripts, constitutes a general immunevasion mechanism employed by a variety of pathogenic viruses.

Targeting of RNA transcripts to axons is one of the mechanisms that allows rapid local translation of proteins in response to extracellular signals.

However, how 3' UTRs contribute to mRNA metabolism and the nature of RBP complexes responsible for these functions remain elusive.
然而，3' utr如何促进mRNA代谢以及负责这些功能的RBP复合物的性质仍然是未知的。


方法: 从(NFG or NT-3处理的)交感神经神经元的`细胞体 和 轴突` 分别提取RNA，做3端测序。
We performed 3' end sequencing of RNA isolated from cell bodies and axons of sympathetic neurons exposed to either Nerve Growth factor (NGF) or Neurotrophin 3 (NT-3). 

- sympathetic [ˌsɪmpəˈθetɪk] adj. 同情的，有同情心的；交感神经的，自主神经系统的；

NGF and NT-3 are growth factors essential for sympathetic neuron development through distinct signalling mechanisms. Whereas NT-3 acts mostly locally, NGF signal is retrogradely transported from axons to cell bodies. 

- NT-3: 局部起作用
- NGF: 从轴突转运到细胞体


结果:
We discovered that both NGF and NT-3 affect transcription and alternative polyadenylation in the nucleus and induce the localization of specific 3'UTR isoforms to axons, including short 3'UTR isoforms found exclusively in axons. 
在轴突也发现 短转录本。

整合 CLIP 测序数据: 长UTR转录本结合RBP，到达轴突后，变成短转录本。
The integration of our data with CLIP sequencing data supports a model whereby long 3'UTR isoforms associate with RBP complexes in the nucleus, and upon reaching the axons, are remodelled locally into shorter isoforms. 

结论:
Our findings shed new light into the complex relationship between nuclear polyadenylation, mRNA localisation and local 3'UTR remodelling in developing neurons.

The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is a widely cultivated shellfish in the world, while its transcriptome diversity remains less unexplored due to the limitation of short reads.

We further developed a Drupal based webserver, Cgtdb, which can be used for transcriptome visualization, sequence alignment, and functional genome annotation analyses.

This work provides valuable resources and a useful tool for integrative analysis of various transcriptome datasets in C. gigas, which will serve as an essential reference for functional annotation of the oyster genome.









# 主导的polyA信号可用于变异分类(Hum Mol Genet, IF=5.121)
> Genome-wide identification of dominant polyadenylation hexamers for use in variant classification

> Center for Precision Health Research. UK
> PMID: 37606238

Yet, only 14 Mendelian disorders have been associated with hexamer variants. This is likely an under-ascertainment as hexamers are not well defined and not routinely examined in molecular analysis.

在种群中，
主导的polyA信号，其相关变异较低，相对于非主导对照和三聚体。
The predominant hexamers had fewer observed variants compared to non-predominant hexamers and trimer controls, and CADD scores for variants in these hexamers were significantly higher than controls.


我们建议：这些主导polyA信号可用于研究 外显子和基因组数据。
We suggest this list of predominant hexamers can be used to interrogate exome and genome data. 

这些主导polyA信号区域的变异，可以作为人类疾病的候选，为此，提出六聚体突变作为疾病分类标准。
Variants in these predominant hexamers should be considered candidates for pathogenic variation in human disease, and to that end we suggest pathogenicity criteria for classifying hexamer variants.
