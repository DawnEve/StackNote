静息干细胞对维持干细胞池很重要！
The quiescent state is actively controlled and is essential for long-term maintenance of stem cell pools. 

不同的静息干细胞
In this Review, we discuss the importance of maintaining a functional pool of quiescent adult stem cells, including haematopoietic stem cells, skeletal muscle stem cells, neural stem cells, hair follicle stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells such as fibro-adipogenic progenitors, to ensure tissue maintenance and repair.

静息态的维持、进入、退出的分子机制
We discuss the molecular mechanisms that regulate the entry into, maintenance of, and exit from the quiescent state in mice.


静息态干细胞的RNA和蛋白质不一致。可能与APA有关
Recent studies revealed that quiescent stem cells have a discordance between RNA and protein levels, indicating the importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms, such as alternative polyadenylation, alternative splicing, and translation repression, in the control of stem cell quiescence.

Understanding how these mechanisms guide stem cell function during homeostasis and regeneration has important implications for regenerative medicine.

Additionally, we provided a systemic view of alternative polyadenylation events in different cell types, as well as their cell-type-specific changes during aging and under different pro-longevity conditions. 

Together, this study provides molecular insights into how aging occurs in different cell types and how they respond to pro-longevity strategies.

About 10-20% of patients with bladder cancer (BC) progress to muscle-invasive diseases, of which the underlying key molecular events have yet to be addressed.

Here, we identified poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1), a general factor of alternative polyadenylation (APA), was downregulated in BC. 

PABPN1结合倾向性取决于 polyA signal 的相对位置。
Mechanistically, we provide evidence that the preference of PABPN1-bound polyadenylation signals (PASs) depends on the relative location between canonical and non-canonical PASs. PABPN1 shapes inputs converging on Wnt signaling, cell cycle, and lipid biosynthesis.

approximately 97.5% of the human genome is transcribed into non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). 

This paradigm shift has led to an explosion of research interest in different classes of non-coding RNAs, such as circular RNAs (circRNAs) as well as non-coding untranslated regions (UTRs) of protein-coding messenger RNAs.

The critical roles of circRNAs and UTRs in AML pathogenesis have become increasingly apparent.

Finally, we discuss the potential of circRNAs and 3'UTRs as new biomarkers for disease stratification and/or the prediction of treatment response and targets for the development of RNA-directed therapeutic applications.

The present review focuses on the functions of APA, miRNA and their interaction and roles in development of different types of tumors.

Most studies focus on APA within the 3'UTR; however, here, we show that CPSF6 insufficiency alters protein levels and causes a developmental syndrome by deregulating APA throughout the transcript. 

斑马鱼中，缺乏 CPSF6导致polyA位点使用在3UTR和内含子区 按信号通路依赖的方式切换。
In neonatal humans and zebrafish larvae, CPSF6 insufficiency shifts poly(A) site usage between the 3'UTR and internal sites in a pathway-specific manner.

This suggests that, under healthy conditions, cells toggle between internal and 3'UTR APA to modulate protein expression.

Regulation of mRNA polyadenylation is important for response to external signals and differentiation in several cell types, and results in mRNA isoforms that vary in the amount of coding sequence or 3' UTR regulatory elements.

本文，我们发现巨噬细胞分化的特征是相关细胞通路中mRNA的缩短和延长。
In this study, we show that macrophage differentiation is characterized by shortening and lengthening of mRNAs in relevant cellular pathways.

The cleavage/polyadenylation (C/P) proteins increase during differentiation, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed changes in poly(A) site usage. 

这很奇怪，因为其他系统中的高 C/P 蛋白水平和高细胞分裂速度相关，但是单核细胞在诱导分化后停止分裂。
This was surprising since higher C/P protein levels correlate with higher proliferation rates in other systems, but monocytes stop dividing after induction of differentiation.

Depletion of CstF64, a C/P protein and known regulator of polyadenylation efficiency, delayed macrophage marker expression, cell cycle exit, attachment, and acquisition of structural complexity, and impeded shortening of mRNAs with functions relevant to macrophage biology. 

相反，CstF64 过表达增加了启动子-近端polyA位点的使用，导致不诱导就出现分化表型。
Conversely, CstF64 overexpression increased use of promoter-proximal poly(A) sites and caused the appearance of differentiated phenotypes in the absence of induction. 

我们的发现表明APA在巨噬细胞分化中发挥重要作用。
Our findings indicate that regulation of polyadenylation plays an important role in macrophage differentiation.

> University de Sherbrooke.

Although many viral systems are known to translate proteins from mRNAs with retained introns, restriction mechanisms generally prevent export and translation of incompletely spliced mRNAs. Here we provide evidence that the human nuclear poly(A)-binding protein, PABPN1, functions in such restriction.
