The genotyping and expression array data were obtained for all 278 LCLs and were quality controlled as previously described (Li et al., 2008; Niu et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2013). These data are publicly available from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under Super Series accession numbers `GSE24277` and `GSE23120`. 

We used microarrays to identify the variation of basal gene expression level among `287 lymphoblastoid cell lines`.

Therefore, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify biomarkers to help predict radiation response using 277 ethnically defined human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Basal gene expression levels and 1.3 million genome-wide SNP markers from both Affymetrix and Illumina platforms were assayed for all 277 human LCLs.



## Transient transfection and RNA interference

SiRNAs for the candidate genes and negative control siRNA were purchased from QIAGEN (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). 4–5 × 106 cells were transfected with 500 nM of siRNA using Amaxa™ Cell Line Nucleofector™ transfection kit (Lonza, Koeln, Germany). After incubation overnight, cells were plated in 96-well plate for further drug treatment and MTS assay.
