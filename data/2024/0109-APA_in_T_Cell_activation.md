Moreover, the transcriptional heterogeneity and posttranscriptional gene expression regulation such as alternative polyadenylation at different stages are also unknown.

Finally, we quantified the transcriptome-wide changes in alternative polyadenylation across T-cell development and found diverse preferences of polyadenylation site usage in divergent populations along the T-cell commitment trajectory.

Discussion: In summary, our results revealed transcriptional heterogeneity and a dynamic landscape of alternative polyadenylation during T-cell development in both human prenatal and postnatal thymus, providing a comprehensive resource for understanding T lymphopoiesis in human thymus.

- U1 snRNP, 
- small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U1
- The spliceosome, a large complex containing five conserved `small ribonucleoprotein particles` (snRNPs) U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6, plays important roles in precursor messenger RNA splicing

真核细胞中，splicing和APA在基因调控网络中起重要作用。
In eukaryotic cells, both alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation (APA) play essential roles in the gene regulation network. 

U1 小核蛋白颗粒(U1 snRNP)是剪切复合体的一个主要的组件，U1 snRNP复合体通过与3'端处理因子互作，抑制近端pA的使用。
U1 small ribonucleoprotein particle (U1 snRNP) is a major component of spliceosome, and U1 snRNP complex can suppress proximal APA sites through crosstalking with 3' end processing factors.

然而，我们敲除或过表达U1 snRNP的蛋白组分 SNRPA, SNRPC, SNRNP70, and SNRPD2，都在转录水平上促进近端pA的使用。
However, here we show that both knockdown and overexpression of SNRPA, SNRPC, SNRNP70, and SNRPD2, the U1 snRNP proteins, promote the usage of proximal APA sites at the transcriptome level. 

SNRNP70 驱动PABPN1从液滴到聚合的状态转移，降低 PABPN1 对近端pA的抑制作用。
SNRNP70 can drive the phase transition of PABPN1 from droplet to aggregate, which may reduce the repressive effects of PABPN1 on the proximal APA sites. 

另外，SNRNP70 能通过招募 CPSF6 促进近端 pA 位点，这表明 CPSF6 对APA的功能相关其他RNA结合蛋白，且是细胞上下文依赖的。
Additionally, SNRNP70 can also promote the proximal APA sites by recruiting CPSF6, suggesting that the function of CPSF6 on APA is related with other RNA-binding proteins and cell context-dependent.


结果：和U1 snRNP复合体相反，它的几个自由单体蛋白可以通过与3’端处理机器结合，促进近端pA的使用。
Consequently, these results reveal that, on the contrary to U1 snRNP complex, the free proteins of U1 snRNP complex can promote proximal APA sites through the interaction with 3' end processing machinery.

# 肿瘤中的3UTR缩短和蛋白代谢相关(RNA. 2021)

To resolve this, we developed a computational method, called `SCUREL`, that quantifies changes in 3' UTR length between groups of cells, including cells of the same type originating from tumor and control tissue. 

We used this method to study APA in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). 

SCUREL relies solely on `annotated 3' UTRs` and on control systems such as `T cell activation`, and spermatogenesis gives qualitatively similar results at much greater sensitivity compared to the previously published `scAPA` method.










# Th1细胞分化中介导SNRPA的STAT5B的APA(J Immunol. 2017 Good)
> Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide A-Mediated Alternative Polyadenylation of STAT5B during Th1 Cell Differentiation

`T cells are activated and differentiated into Th cells` depending on the rapid and accurate changes in the cell transcriptome. In addition to changes in mRNA expression, the sequences of many transcripts are altered by alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation (APA). 

We profiled the `APA sites of human CD4+ T cell subsets` with high-throughput sequencing and found that `Th1 cells harbored more genes with shorter tandem 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) than did naive T cells`.

直接有APA的分子： STAT5B, a key regulator of Th1 differentiation, possessed three major APA sites and preferred shorter 3' UTRs in Th1 cells. 

上游分子：In addition, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide A (SNRPA) was found to bind directly to STAT5B 3' UTR and facilitate its APA switching. 

通路：We also found that p65 activation triggered by TCR signaling could promote SNRPA transcription and 3' UTR shortening of STAT5B.

结论： Thus we propose that the APA switching of STAT5B induced by TCR activation is mediated by SNRPA.


## 正文

The genes with altered expression were enriched in the cell cycle, DNA metabolic processes, cellular response to stress, organelle fission, and macromolecular complex assembly (Fig. 2D).


- Table I. GO terms for genes with significant switching to longer or shorter UTRs
GO analysis of 404 APA site-switching genes in Th1 cells was performed by DAVID.
Mitochondrial membrane organization 6

Subsequent analysis of gene function by DAVID showed that APA genes were enriched in the regulation of macromolecular processes and transcription, whereas genes with significantly altered expression were enriched in cell cycle–related functions, chromosome organization, and cellular responses (Fig. 2, Table I).

- APA 改变的基因： 大分子代谢、转录
- 表达 改变的基因： 细胞周期、染色体组织、细胞响应。
